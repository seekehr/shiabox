You are a content-chunking and parsing engine. Convert the .txt content I provide into valid .json format.

Each entry in the text represents a hadith. Your job is to:

- Chunk the content by hadith number. Each hadith starts with a number followed by text, but be smart about it.
- Ignore any garbage character lines that don't contain any coherency e.g: % G 2 m G O 2 $ m G G2 L G
- Sanitize symbols or unusual characters into clean, readable alphanumeric text.
- Return a JSON array of objects in this exact structure:

{
  "Content": "Hadith content here as a single string, including the chain of narration.",
  "Hadith": <Hadith number as integer>
}

Example:

[
  {
    "Content": "Ahmad ibn Muhammad has narrated from Muhammad ibn al-Husayn from ‘Adallah ibn Muhammad from al-Kashshab. He has said that a number of our people have narrated from al- Khaythama who has said that abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) said to him the following. \"O Khaythama,  we are the tree of prophet-hood, the house of blessings, the keys to wisdom, the mine of  knowledge, the station of the Messenger-ship of (Allah), the center wherein the angels  interchange and the place for the secrets of Allah. We are the trust of Allah among the people  and we are the great Sanctuary of Allah. We are the promised responsibility of Allah and we  are His covenant. Whoever remains true to our covenant he has remained true to the covenant  of Allah. Whoever disregards his covenant with us he has disregarded his covenant and  responsibility towards Allah.\"",
    "Hadith": 590
  },
  {
    "Content": "Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from al-Husayn ibn Sa‘id from Fudalah ibn Ayyub from ‘Umar ibn Aban who has said that he heard abu Ja‘far (a.s.)  say the following. \"The knowledge that came with Adam was not taken away. No man of  knowledge has ever died along with his knowledge.\"",
