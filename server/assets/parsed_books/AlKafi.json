"Content": "Abu ‘Abdallah al-Ash‘ari has narrated from certain persons of our people have narrated in a marfu‘ manner from Hisham ibn al-Hakam who has said the following.   \"Abu al-Hassan Musa ibn Ja’far stated the following to me. ‘O Hisham, Allah has given good news to  the people of reason and understanding in His book in the following words, \" Give the good news to  those of My servants who hear certain words but follow only the good words. These are the ones whom  Allah has given guidance and they are the people of understanding. 39:20 Holy Quran\"O Hisham, it is certain that Allah has established complete (legal) authority for people (to refer to) in the form of intelligence, supported the messengers through the (ability) to communicate and has guided  them to His own Lordship with proofs. Saying, \"Your Lord is the only Lord. There is no God but He,  the Beneficent, the Merciful (2:163)\"(Of the signs of His existence are the creation of heavens and earth, the alternation of nights and days, the ships that sail in the sea for the benefit of the people. (Also of such signs are) the water that God  sends from the sky to revive the dead earth where He has scattered all kinds of animals, the winds of all  directions and the clouds that are rendered for service between the sky and the earth. Such are evidence (of His existence) for those who use their intelligence. (2:164)\"O Hisham, Allah has mentioned the above facts as proof of His existence and that such facts depend upon the will of one who has designed them saying:\"God has made the day and the night, the sun and the moon, and all the stars subservient to you by His command. In this there is evidence of the truth for people of understanding. (16:12)\"It is He, Who created you from clay, turning it into a living germ, then into a clot of blood, and then brings you forth as a child. He then made you grow into manhood and become old. He causes some of  you to live for the appointed time and some of you to die before so that perhaps you may have  understanding (40:67). \"In the heavens and the earth there is evidence (of the Truth) for the believers (45:3). In your creation and in that of the beasts living on earth there is evidence of the Truth for the people who have strong  faith (45:4). In the alternation of the night and the day, the sustenance which God has sent down from  the sky to revive the barren earth, and in the changing of the direction of the winds there is evidence of  the truth for the people of understanding (45:5).  \"Know that God brings the dead earth back to life. We have explained Our revelations to you so that you may perhaps have understanding (57:17).\"In the earth there are adjacent pieces of land, vineyards, farms, date-palms of single and many roots which are all watered by the same water. We have made some yield a better food than others. All this is evidence (of the existence of God) for the people who understand. (13:4)\"Also, of the evidence of His existence are His showing you lightening which gives you fear and hope and His sending water down from the sky which revives the earth after its death. In this there is evidence  (of the truth) for the people of understanding. (30:24)\"(Muhammad), say, \"Let me tell you about what your Lord has commanded: Do not consider anything equal to God; Be kind to your parents; Do not murder your children out of fear of poverty, for We give  sustenance to you and to them. Do not even approach indecency either in public or in private. Take not a  life, which God has made sacred except by way of justice and law. Thus does He command you that you  may learn wisdom. (6:151)\"God has told you this parable about yourselves: Could your slaves share your wealth equally with you and could you fear them as you fear yourselves? Thus, do We clarify the evidence (of the truth) for the  people of understanding (30:28). \"O Hisham, Allah then has given good advise to the people of intelligence and has encouraged them to become interested in the life to come saying, \"The worldly life is but useless amusement and sport  (compared to) the life hereafter which is far better and is only for the pious. Will you not then  understand? (6:32)\"O Hisham, Allah then has given warnings to those who do not think about the punishment that may come upon them from Allah saying, \"Then We totally destroyed the others (37:136). You pass by (their  ruined town) in the morning and at night (37:137). Will you then not understand? (37:138)\"We will bring torment from the sky on this town because of the evil-deeds of its inhabitants\" (29:34). We left manifest evidence (of the truth) there for the people of understanding. (29:35)\"O Hisham, intelligence comes with knowledge.\" Allah has said, \"These are parables which, We tell to human beings, but only the learned ones understand them. (29:43)\"O Hisham, Allah has then expressed dislike towards those who do not understand in the following words: \"When certain people are asked to follow the revelations of God, they say, ‘We would rather  follow what our fathers have followed,’ even though their fathers had no understanding and could not  find the true guidance (2:170) \"Preaching to unbelievers is like talking to someone who cannot hear anything except yells and shouts. They are deaf, dumb, and blind; they have no understanding. (2:171)\"Some of them will look at you, but are you supposed to guide the blind even if they have no vision? (10:43)  \"Do you think that most of them listen and understand? They are like cattle or even more, straying and confused. (25:44)\"They will not fight you united except with the protection of fortified towns or from behind walls. They are strong among themselves. You think that they are united, but in fact, their hearts are divided. They  are a people who have no understanding (59:14)\"Would you order people to do good deeds and forget to do them yourselves even though you read the Book? Why do you not think?\" (2:44)\"O Hisham, Allah then has expressed dislike towards the multitudes saying, \"Most of the people in the land will lead you away from God's guidance if you follow them; they only follow their own conjecture  and preach falsehood (6:116)\"If you ask them, \"Who has created the heavens and the earth,\" they will certainly say, \"God has created them.\" Say, \"It is only God who deserves all praise, but most of them do not know\" (31:25)\"If you ask them, \"Who has sent down water from the sky to revive the dead earth?\" They will say, \"God has done it.\" Say, \"It is only God who deserves all praise, but many of them do not  understand.\" (29:63)\"O Hisham, Allah then has praised those fewer in numbers saying, \"Only few of my servants are grateful.\" (34:13) He has said, \"How few are they?\" \"A believing person from the people of the Pharaoh who concealed his faith said, \"Would you kill a man just because he says God is my Lord?\" (40:28)\"No one believed in him, except a few. (11:40)Tell them, (Muhammad), \"God certainly has the Power to show such miracles but many of them are ignorant.\" (6:37). \"Many of them have no understanding. (5:103)Many of them do not realize.\" \"O Hisham, Allah has mentioned the people of intelligence in the best manners with the best of characteristics saying, \"God gives wisdom to the ones whom He wants. Whoever is given wisdom, has,  certainly, received much good. Only people of intelligence can grasp this (2:269).\" . . . those who have a firm grounding in knowledge say, \"We believe in it. All its verses are from our Lord.\" No one can grasp this fact except the people of Intelligence . . .\" (3:7)  \"The creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and the night are evidence (of the existence of God) for people of Intelligence. (3:190)\"Can a person, who knows that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, be considered equal to a blind person? Only those who have understanding take heed (13:19).\"Can this one be considered equal to one who worships God during the night, prostrating and standing, who has fear of the Day of Judgment, and who has hope in the mercy of his Lord? Say, \"Are those who  know equal to those who do not know? Only the people of Intelligence take heed\" (39:9).\"It is a blessed Book which We have revealed for you so that you will reflect upon its verses and so the people of understanding will take heed (38:29).\"To Moses We had given guidance and to the children of Israel We had given the Book (40:53) as their inheritance and as a guide and a reminder to the people of understanding (40:54)\"Keep on reminding them. This benefits the believers\" (51:55). \"O Hisham, Allah says in His book, \"This is a reminder for the ones who understands, listens, and sees.\" (50:37)It means intelligence. \"We gave wisdom to Luqman so that he would give thanks to God . . . .\" (31:12) Understand is intelligence.\"O Hisham, Luqman said to his son, \" Venerate the truth you will be the most intelligent among man. Cleverness before intelligence has a very small value. My son, the world is a very deep ocean in which  many people have drowned. You must take piety before God as the ship, faith as supplies therein, trust  in God as the sales, intelligence as the captain, knowledge as the guide and patience as passengers.\"\"O Hisham, for everything there is a guide. The guide for intelligence is thinking. The guide for thinking is silence. For everything there is a means for mobility the means of mobility for intelligence is humble  attitude. To disobey a prohibition is enough proof of ones ignorance.\"O Hisham, Allah send His messengers to people for no other reason but that they would have understanding about Him. Those who obey Him better have better understanding about Him. Those who  are more knowledgeable in the commandment of Allah are the ones who have more powerful  intelligence and those who have more powerful intelligence are at a higher degree of excellence in this  world and in the next life.\"O Hisham, Allah has placed two kinds of authority over man.1The apparent and manifest authority and the internal and hidden authority The prophets and messengers   are the apparent and manifest authorities and intelligence is the hidden and internal authority.\"O Hisham, a man of intelligence is one whose thankfulness doe not diminish because of a large wealth and prohibited matters can not overpower his patience.\"O Hisham, one who would support three things against an other three kinds of things he would be leading to the destruction of his own intelligence.(1) Darkening of one’s ability to think with day dreaming, (2) the abolishment of the sparks of one’s wisdom with excessive bluffs and (3) the extinguishing of the lights of the lessons from experience by  the desires of one’s soul.It would be like supporting ones desire to destroy ones own intelligence. One who would destroy his own intelligence he has destroyed his own worldly life as well as the life to come.\"O Hisham how would you expect to have pure deeds before Allah when you have such things that keep you away from the facts that matter to Allah, your Lord, and you have obeyed your desires against your  own intelligence.\"O Hisham, maintaining patience in loneliness is a sign of the strength of intelligence. One who has understanding about Allah he keeps himself aside from the people of this world and those interested in  it. He becomes interested in what is with Allah. Allah then gives him comfort in his fear and company  when he is lonely. Allah gives him riches in his poverty and honor without the existence of his  tribesmen.\"O Hisham, truth is set up so that Allah is obeyed. There is no salvation without obedience to Allah. Obedience comes only from knowledge, which comes from learning that receives strength from  intelligence. The only knowledge of value is that of one who knows about the Lord and intelligence  discerns the valuable of knowledge.\"O Hisham, smaller degrees of deeds with knowledge are accepted with double value and large amounts of deeds from those who follow their desires and ignorance are rejected.\"O Hisham, a person of intelligence is pleased with little things of the world with wisdom but he does not agree with a little wisdom with all of the world and, thus, such people strike a gainful bargain.\"O Hisham, the people of intelligence stay away from what is more than the basic necessities of life how then they would not stay away from the sins in this world. To stay away from what is more than the bare  necessities is only extra virtue but staying away from sins is obligatory.\"O Hisham, a man of intelligence observes the world and the people of the world and finds out that the worldly gains come only through hard works and labor. He finds out that gains of the life hereafter also  come through hard work and labor he then accepts the one that is more durable.\"O Hisham, people of intelligence hold themselves back from the worldly things and strengthen interest in the gains of the life hereafter. They have learned that the worldly gains are sought after and are   wanted and so also are the gains of the lifer hereafter. One who seeks the gains of the life hereafter the world will seek him to deliver to him his livelihood but one who seeks the worldly gains the hereafter  would also seek to find him. Death will then approach him and it will destroy his world and leave him  with no opportunity in the life hereafter (because he had gained nothing).\"O Hisham, one who wants self-sufficiency without property, comfort for his heart from the evil of jealousy and the safety of his religion he should pray to Allah, the Most Glorious, to perfect his intelligence. The person of intelligence is satisfied with the basic necessities and one who agrees with basic necessities he is self-sufficient and free of needs and one who is not satisfied with basic necessities  he is never free from wants.\"O Hisham, Allah has stated the following on behalf of the people of virtue, \"They say, \"Lord, do not cause our hearts to deviate from Your guidance, and grant us mercy. You are the Most Awarding  One.\" (3:8) They know that hearts may deviate and turn towards blindness and destruction.It is certain that those who do not fear Allah have no understanding about Him. One who does not have proper understanding about Allah one’s heart does not establish any stable gnosis about Allah with clear  awareness of such gnosis that one would find in his heart. No one can be as such except those whose deeds would confirm their words and their privacy would agree with their public activities. This is because Allah, Sacrosanct are whose names, has not shown what is private and unknown form  intelligence except through what is public from it and speaks for it.\"O Hisham, the commander of the true believers, Imam Ali (a.s) has said, \"Allah is worshipped better by no means other than intelligence. No one’s intelligence reaches perfection until therewith is found  various qualities. Disbelief and evil should not emerge therefrom. Wisdom and goodness should be  expected to exist therewith. The extra of the property of a person of intelligence is given in charity, the  extra of his words is restrained and his share of the worldly things is only the basic necessities. He never  considers himself as to have learned enough. To be with Allah, although in a very humble state, is far  better to him than to live very much honored with others. Humbleness is more beloved to him than  being taken as a dignitary. He considers virtuous deeds of others a great deal and his own virtuous deeds  as insignificant. He considers all the other people better than his self and his own self as the worse of all  and this is the totality of all things.\"\"O Hisham, a man of intelligence never speaks a lie even though it may satisfy his desires.\"\"O Hisham, one who does not maintain honorable kindness he has no religion and one can not have such noble character without intelligence. A person of the greatest value among people is one who does not  consider the worldly gains his fortune. Nothing can become an adequate price for your bodies other than  paradise. Do not sell it for any thing other than paradise.\"O Hisham, the commander of the true believers, Imam Ali (a.s) has said, \"Three noble qualities in man are of the signs of the existence of intelligence. He replies when questioned and he speaks up only when  everyone else fails to speak and offers his advise when it is beneficial to his people. One who has none  of these qualities is a fool.\" He also has said, \"No one other a person who has all of the above or some of  such qualities should chair a gathering and if one does so without any of such qualities he is a fool.\"Imam Hassan ibn Ali (a.s) has said, \"If you would ask for help do so from a proper source.\" He was   asked, \"O grandson of the holy Prophet, ‘Who are the proper sources?\" He replied, \"They are those about whom Allah has spoken in His book saying, \"Only those who have understanding will take heed  and they are the people of intelligence.\"Imam Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s) has said, \"Sitting in the company of virtuous people leads one to virtue and association with the scholars is a means of strengthening one’s intelligence. Obedience to the  authorities that practice justice is an honor. The investment of wealth for profit is a dignifying practice.  Guiding one who asks for guidance is an expression of gratitude. To restrain ones harmful manners and deeds is because of the perfection of one’s intelligence in which there is comfort for the body in the short and long terms.\"\"O Hisham, a man of intelligence does not speak to one who is feared to call him a liar. He does not ask those that he fears may deny him. He does not count on what is not within his abilities. He does not  maintain any hope in that which may involve severity and harshness. He does not take any steps towards  which he fears may not be achieved due to his inability.\"",

A discussion on intelligence and ignorance began to emerge among them. Thereupon Imam abu ‘Abdallah said, \"You,  first, must recognize intelligence and its army and ignorance and its army only then you would find  proper guidance.\" I then asked, may Allah make my soul of service to you, we only learn what you teach  us.\" The Imam (a.s) said, \"Allah, the Glorious, the Majestic created intelligence and it was the first creature of spiritual world on the right side of the Throne from His light. He then told him to move backwards and intelligence moved backwards. He then told him to come forwards. Intelligence came  forwards. Allah, the Sacrosanct, the Most High said, \"I have created you a great creature and honored  you above all others of my creatures. The Imam (a.s) continued, \"Allah then created ignorance from a  salty dark ocean and told it, \"move backwards and did move backwards. He then called it to come  forwards but it did not come forwards. He then said to it, ‘Did you shun coming forwards?\" He then   pronounced it condemned. He then assigned seventy-five armies for intelligence. When ignorance saw all the honors Allah has granted to intelligence it bore hidden animosity towards intelligence and said,  \"Lord this creature is just like me. You created and honored it and gave it power. But I have no power  against it. Give me also likewise armies. The Lord then said, \"I will give you also an army but if you  would disobey Me I will then expel you and your army from My mercy.

In such case they also will step at  the high degree and level of the prophets and the successors of the prophets. This progress can only be  made after knowing, with certainty, intelligence and its army and ignorance and its army.

That it is the creator that is eternal and it is the creatures  that are mortals. It is intelligence with which they reason from His creatures, like the heavens, the earth,  and the sun the moon, night, the day. In this way they learned that they and the creatures have a creator  and maintainer who is eternal. With intelligence they learn about good and bad and that darkness is in  ignorance and light is in knowledge. These are facts that they learn with intelligence.\"People asked the Imam (a.s), \"Can intelligence only be enough for people?\" The Imam (a.s) then replied, ‘With guidance from intelligence that Allah has made him to depend on and it is, his beauty and  guide, a person of intelligence learns that Allah is his creator and that He is his Lord. Through  intelligence one learns that his creator loves and that He dislikes certain things, that the Lord must be  obeyed and that certain acts are disobedience to Him and that nothing but intelligence shows him all  these facts. One also (with intelligence) learns that only with knowledge and searching one may reach  the Creator. That one may not benefit from his intelligence if he can not learn the truth about Him  through his knowledge. It then is necessary for a person of intelligence to acquire knowledge and proper   moral discipline without which there is nothing else so dependable.\"(b) It is narrated from Imam abu ‘Abdallah (a.s) who said, \"No wealth is more profitable and no poverty is more crashing than foolishness and no effort of seeking support is more supportive than seeking  consultation.\"End of the book of Intelligence and Ignorance.All praise belongs to Allah May Allah send peace and blessings upon Muhammad and his holy family.",

A learned person who disregards  his knowledge is like a lost and ignorant person who never comes to the right path due to his  ignorance. In fact, you will find the case against such the learned that disregards his  knowledge more sever and his regret more prolonged, compared to the ignorant person who  wonders about in it. Both people stray and are devoid of goodness. Do not hesitate lest you  will doubt and do not doubt lest you will disbelieve. Do not be lenient to your souls to play  lazy. Do not trivialize the truth lest you will lose badly. It is of the truth to learn Fiqh, proper   understanding of religion. It is of Fiqh, proper understanding of religion not to suffer deceit. The wisest for ones self among you is the one most obedient to his Lord. The most deceitful  to himself among you is the disobedient one to his Lord. One who obeys Allah is safe and  glad news awaits him but one who disobeys his Allah he loses and regrets.’\"",

(c) The group who seeks knowledge for  proper understanding, Fiqh, and power of intelligence. The group whose purpose of seeking  knowledge is ignorance and quarrel is a harmful and quarrelsome group. This group interrupts  conversations in the gatherings of the people to speak about knowledge and the description of  forbearance. Such people appear in the garb of the gentle and humble ones but, in fact, are   devoid of all the qualities of the pious people. Allah has humiliated and has condemned this group. The group that seeks domination and cheating is a deceitful and flattering group. Such  people try to dominate people of their kind and flatter the wealthy ones who know less than  they do. Such people consume the sweetmeat of the rich people and destroy their own  religion. May Allah banish the news of such people and cut off their traces from the history of  the scholars.\"The group that seeks knowledge for the sake of Fiqh, proper understanding, and to gain the power of intelligence consists of people who are deeply concerned and stay awake very often.

He seems a master in  performing prayer and fasting but is a mischief to deceive people; he has strayed from  guidance of the people before him and misleads those who may follow him in his lifetime and  after his death. He carries the responsibility for others sins and is the hostage of his own sins.The other man is one who collects ignorance among the ignorant, himself a captive of darkness of the mischievous. The, humanoids, people who look like people, consider him a   scholar but he has not been even for a complete day with scholars. He has made an early effort to accumulate some thing that its being of a smaller quantity is better than in larger  quantities and in this way he has quenched himself with polluted water and has treasured what  is of no use. He sits among the people as a judge to carry the responsibility of what is  confusing and uncertain to others. He may even oppose the ruling of the judge before him.  One can never tell whether his judgment will remain valid or a judge after him will over turn  it just as he has done to the judgments of the judges before him. If he would face one of the  complex and difficult issues he comes up with a heap of his personal opinions and then he  shapes it up as a clear-cut judgment. In fact, he has dressed himself up with doubtful issue the  way a spider waves his fragile web. He is not sure if he has done the right thing or the wrong  one. He does not consider the fact that in an unknown case to have proper knowledge is  necessary and does not see that beyond his opinion there is a school of law. He analogies one  thing to the other but it does not matter to him if his opinion will turn out to be a lie. If an  issue is dark (not known) to him he hides it to hide his own ignorance so that people will not  say he does not know. He then boldly judges and thus he is the key to hazards, a rider of  doubts, perplexed in ignorance and never regrets his lacking knowledge. The level of his  knowledge never rises to clear-cut certainty so that he would benefit. He blows out Hadith  like winds that blow away hay. The legacies weep from him, the bloods (judging the case of  murder) shout against him. The lawful marital relations become unlawful because of his  judgment and unlawful ones become lawful. He has no confidence in the judgments issues he  can never be trusted for his judgments that he may make nor was he qualified for what he  may have done in the matters that he claimed to have true knowledge.\"",

I have heard a great deal of Hadith and about the  interpretations of the holy Quran. Do you disagree with what have heard from other people  and consider such materials as false? Do you think people ascribe lies to the holy Prophet (s. a.) purposely and interpret by their own personal opinions?\" The Imam then said, \"You have  posed a question now listen carefully.\"What people have consists of the truth, falsehood, lies, what is abrogating, already abrogated, facts of general nature, of particular natures, clear texts, unclear texts, facts  properly memorized and matters that are conjecturally preserved. People had forged certain  narration calling them as Hadith of the holy Prophet. The condition was such that once the  holy Prophet addressed the people from the pulpit saying, \"O people a many lies have spread  around and they are considered to be my Hadith. Whoever forges lies and calls them my  Hadith has filled up his seat with fire. After the holy Prophet (s.a.) there were more of such  lies. There are four kinds of Hadith only and there is no fifth kind.\"One narrator of Hadith is a hypocrite who only pretends to be a Muslim. He does consider it a son and offense to lie and calls a narration purposely a Hadith of the holy Prophet while it is  not a Hadith of the holy Prophet in reality. If people know that he is hypocrite and a liar they  will not believe him. The people say, ‘He lived at the time of the holy Prophet, saw him, has  heard Hadith from him and has preserved those Ahadith but they do not know his condition. It  is certain that Allah has spoken about the hypocrites the way He has spoken about them and  has describe them the way He has describe them. \"Their physical appearance attracts you  when you see them and when they speak, you carefully listen to them . . .\" 63:4 They  hypocrites then sought closeness to the misguiding leaders and those calling other to hell fire   with falsehood, lies and false accusations. The misguiding rulers assigned them for certain offices made them to dominate people. They with their help devoured the world. People  follow only the kings and the worldly gains except for those that Allah has protected. This is  one of the four kinds.\"The other kind is one who has heard Hadith from the holy Prophet by the has preserved it the way it should have been preserved but he is uncertain about it. He has not fabricated anything  purposely and has it with him. He speaks about it, practices accordingly and narrates it  saying; \" I heard it from the holy Prophet (s.a.). If the Muslims would learn that he is  uncertain about it they would accept it from him and if he also would know that there exists  uncertainty in it even he also would reject it.\"The third kind is one who has heard something form the holy Prophet (s.a.) that contained a command but latter the holy Prophet prohibited it but the man did not have any knowledge of  such prohibition. Or that he heard a prohibition form the holy Prophet and then the holy  Prophet made it a command but the man did not know of such commandment. In this way  preserved the abrogated but not the abrogating but if he knew the abrogating thereof he would  have rejected it. If the Muslims knew what they had heard from was abrogated they would  also have rejected it.\"The last and forth kind is one who has not ascribed a lie to the holy Prophet who hates lies has fear of Allah for respect of the holy Prophet (s.a.). He has not forgotten anything but that  he has preserved it the way it should have been preserved. He speaks it just the way has heard  with out any addition or omission. He knows which is abrogating and which is abrogated. He  thus has practiced according to the abrogating and has rejected the abrogated. There is no  doubt that the command so of the holy Prophet (s.a) like the holy Quran is abrogating and  abrogated, of general nature and of particular nature, clear text and unclear text. Oftentimes  the statements of the holy Prophet may have two aspects: Like a general statement and a  statement of a particular nature just like the holy Quran as All, Most Majestic, the Most  Glorious, has said, \" . . .Take only what the Messenger gives to you and desist from what he  forbids you . . .. (59:7)\" It may become confusing for one who does not know what exactly  Allah and His messenger want people to do. All the companions of the holy Prophet were not  as such that would clearly understand the answer to their questions. There were those who  would ask a question but would not ask for explanations and would rather love the coming of  a Bedouin or a stranger and ask the holy Prophet questions so that he would also listen. \"I would go in the presence of the holy Prophet once every day and once every night when he would admit me and we would deal with me the way he wanted. The Sahabah, companions of  the Prophet knew that the holy Prophet would not deal with others the he dealt with me. Also  the Prophet would come to my house most of the time but when I would go to any one of his  houses he would admit me and would ask his wife to leave us alone and then we would have  been the only ones therein. When he would come to my house he would ask Fatimah or any  of my children to leave the house then whatever would ask he would answer me and when I   would have exhausted all of my questions he would begin from his side. Thus, nothing of the holy Quran has ever been revealed the holy prophet had made me to read it and dictated me to  and I wrote it down with my own hand writing. He taught me the interpretations of that verse  and its explanations, its abrogating or that which was abrogated, the clear texts and the  unclear statements, the ones of particular general nature. He would pray to Allah to give me  understanding and strong memory. I never forgot any of the verses of the book of Allah or  any of the knowledge that he had dictated to me which I wrote them down from the time he  prayed to Allah for me. He did not leave any thing of the lawful and unlawful, commands or  prohibitions that were there or that would come into being in future or any book that were  revealed to anyone before him about the matters of obedience or disobedience that he had not  completely taught me and I had not memorized them all. I have not forgotten of them even a  single letter. The holy Prophet once placed his hand on my chest and prayed to Allah to fill  my heart, with knowledge, proper understanding, wisdom and light. I then said, \"O messenger  of Allah, may Allah take the soul of my mother and father in service for your cause, from the  time you prayed for me I have not forgotten a single matter or missed to write down anything.  Do you fear that I might forget them in future? \"I do not fear for you any forgetfulness of  ignorance.\" The holy Prophet (s.a.) replied.’\"",

Anything  received through such judgment would like consuming filth even if it would one’s established  right.

The judgment of the other one will be disregarded.\" I said, \"What if both (of such judges) would be just and accepted among our people and none of them would have been any preference over the other?\"The Imam replied, \"One must consider and study the hadith that each one of them would narrate from us as to which has received the acceptance of all of your people. Such Hadith  must be followed and the one, which rarely accepted and is not popular in your people, must  be disregarded because the one popularly accepted is free of doubts.

(c) And a confusing case the knowledge of which must  be left to Allah and His Prophet for an answer. The holy Prophet has said, ‘There is the  clearly lawful and the clearly unlawful and the confusing cases. One who stays away from the  confusing ones he has protected himself against the unlawful ones. Those who follow the  confusing matters they indulge in unlawful matters and will be destroyed unexpectedly.\"I said, \"What if both Hadith from you would be popular and narrated by the trustworthy people from you?\"The Imam replied, \"One must study to find out which one agrees with the laws of the Quran and the Sunnah and it does not agree with the laws of the those who oppose us.

He traveled to Madina to debate the Imam but he  missed to find the Imam therein. He was told that the Imam has traveled to the city of  Makkah. He then left for Makkah and we were with the Imam (a.s.) when we came across  him during our performing Tawaf (the seven times walking around the Ka‘bah). The man’s  name was ‘Abdul Malik also called abu ‘Abdallah as his Kunyah in Arabic. He touched Imam  abu ‘Abdallah’s shoulder with his shoulder as he walked along. The Imam asked him, \"What  is your name?\" It is ‘Abdul Malik (meaning slave of the King).\" The man replied. \"What is  your Kunyah?\" The Imam (a.s.) asked. \"It is abu ‘Abdallah (meaning father of slave of  Allah).\" He replied. The Imam then asked, \"Who is this king whose slave you are? Is he of  the earthly kings or of the heavenly ones? Tell us about your son. Is he a slave of the Lord of  the heavens or a slave of the Lord of the earth? Say whatever you may it will be against you.\"  Hisham has said that I asked him (the heretic man), \"Why do you not answer?\" The man  seemed to dislike my words. The Imam (a.s.) then told him, \"Meet us when we finish our  Tawaf (walking around the Ka‘bah).\" The heretic man came to the Imam (a.s) later and sat in  front of the Imam (a.s.) and we were all gathered around him.The Imam (a.s.) then asked him, \"Do you know that the earth has an underside and an upperside?\" The man replied, \"Yes, I know it.\" The Imam then asked, \"Have you gone in the  underside of the earth?\" The man replied, \"No, I have not gone there.\" The Imam (a.s.) then  asked, \"Do you know what is therein?\" He said, \"I do not know but I guess there is nothing  therein.\" The Imam (a.s.) then said, \"Guessing is weakness. Why do you not acquire  certainty?\" The Imam (a.s.) then asked, \"Have you climbed up into the sky?\" The man replied, \"No, I have not done so.\" The Imam (a.s.) then asked, \"Do you know what is up there?\" He replied, \"No, I do not know.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"It is very strange.  Without reaching the East or West, without going under the earth or climbing up the sky and  not even have crossed anything to know what is behind you deny what is in them. Does any  man of reason deny what he does not know?\"   The heretic man then said, \"No one has ever come up with such statements to me as you have.\" The Imam (a.s.) then said, \"So you are uncertain about Him. Perhaps He is or may be  He does not exist.\" The heretic man then said, \"Perhaps He is.\" The Imam then said, \"O man,  one who does not know has no authority over the one who knows. O Egyptian brethren, listen  carefully. We have no doubts in the existence of Allah (God). Think about the sun, the moon,  the day and the nights follow each other and do not miss their turns or become confused.  They each have its place and do not have any choice. If they had any other choice they would  not come back again. If they had a choice the day would not end with night and the night  would not end in the day. They are forced to continue, O Egyptian brethren, I swear byAllah  (God). The One who has forced them is stronger then them and greater.What people speak of and you guess it is (dahr) motionless time if it was so, then when it would take them away it would not return them and if time have returned them then why it is  not taking them away? These things, O Egyptian brethren, are compelled. Why the sky is up  high and why the earth is low? Why the sky does not fall down on earth? Why the earth does  not flow one layer over the other and the two do not stick to each other and why those on it do  not stick to it?\"The man then said, \"God their Lord has made them to hold together.\" Hisham has said, \"He professed belief in God in the presence of Imam abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.).\"\"Humran then said to the Imam, \"May Allah take my soul in service for your cause, if heretics profess belief in Allah (God) before you it is because the unbelievers converted to faith  because of your father.\" The man who had just professed belief in Allah requested Imam abu  ‘Abdallah (a.s.) to allow him to become one of his students. The Imam then asked Hisham to  teach him. Hisham taught him well and he became a teacher for the people in Syria and  Egypt.

Of all these no one deserves to be called a human being accept that Shaikh sitting there,  meaning thereby Imam abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.). The rest is garble and beasts.\" Upon this ibn abu  al-‘Awja’ said, \"For what reason do you call him a human being and not the rest?\" Ibn al-  Muqaffa‘ then replied, \"Because I saw with him what I did not see with the others.\" Ibn abu al-\"Awja’ then said, \"We must test your claim.\" Ibn al-Muqaffa‘ then said, \"I advise you not  to do so lest you will lose whatever faith you have. Ibn abu al-‘Awja’ then said, \"I do not  think that is what you mean. I think you are afraid of failing to substantiate what you have just  said about this man.\" Ibn al-Muqaffa‘ then said, \"If that is what you think then go to him and  protect yourself as much as you can. Be strong as much as you can so you are not harnnessed  and note all points against and in your favor. Ibn abu al-‘Awja’ then left and ibn al-Muqaffa‘  and I remained there. When ibn abu al-‘Awja’ returned he said, \"Woe is you, O ibn al- Muqaffa‘. This is not a human being even though he lives in this world. He is a spiritual being  but appears in the form of man whenever he wants the out world and turns into a spiritual  being whenever he wants the inner world. That is the way he is.\" Ibn al-Muqaffa‘ then asked,  \"How does that happen?\" Ibn abu al-‘Awja’ then said, \"I sat near him and when everyone had  gone he turned to me and said, \"If it is the way they (people walking around the Ka‘bah) say,  which is true then they are saved and you are destroyed. If it is the way you say it is, which is  not so then you and they are all equal.\" I then asked, \"May Allah be kind to you. What is it  that we say and what is it that they say? We all say the same thing.\" He said, \"How can what  you say be equal to what they say? They say that they will have a return, a day of receiving  their rewards and penalties. They believe in a religion which says that in the heavens is the  Lord and that they are habitable while you say that they are in ruins and there is nothing in  them.\"Ibn abu al-‘Awja’ has said, \"I then found the opportunity to speak and I asked, \"What  then keeps this Lord, if it is true the way they say that He exists, from appearing to His  creatures and call them to His worship so that no two people would oppose each other? Why  is He hiding from them and has only sent messengers? If He would have been in direct  contact with them it would have been more helpful to have faith in Him.\" He then responded,  \"Woe is you, how someone who is already shown His power within you is hiding from you?  He brought you up. You did not even exist. He made you grow when you were so small. He  gave you strength and power when you were so weak and will make you weak again after  being strong. He make you sick after being healthy and can give you good health after  suffering sickness. He can make you happy after you experience anger and make you angry  after being happy. He can make you sad after your joy and give you joy after sadness. He can  give love after your experiencing hatred and hatred after enjoying love. He can give you  determination after your uncertainty and uncertainty after having determination. He can give  you strong desires after your experiencing dislike and dislike after having strong desires. He  can give you willingness after experiencing fear and concerns and fear after having strong  willingness. He can give you hope after despair and despair after having a great deal of hope.  He can give you good remembrance of what you had no idea and remove what you may have  had as a belief.\" He kept reminding and counting for me the effects of His power within my  soul that I could not deny and I begin to have a feeling that all that is between me and him  will all appear in the open.\"From the same source the following is narrated from a number of our people in a Marfu‘ manner as additional statements to the above discourse of ibn abu al-‘Awja’ with Imam abu  ‘Abdallah (a.s.). That abu al-‘Awja’ came the next day to the meeting of the Imam and sat   down quietly. The Imam (a.s.) said to him, \"Would you like to review the issues we discussed yesterday?\" He replied, \"I did intend to do so, O son of the messenger of Allah.\" The Imam  then said, \"It is strange that one who does not believe in Allah acknowledges the existence of  the messenger of Allah.\" He replied, \"It is only the habit that made me say so.\" The ‘Alim  (the Imam) then asked, \"What is it that keeps you quite?\" He replied, \"It is your excellence  and awesome spiritual ability that hold my tongue back from speaking. I have seen many  scholars and have debated many theologians but I never experienced such an awesome feeling  from them as I feel in your presence.\" The Imam then said, \" It may happen. I would like to  open this session with a question to you. The Imam turned to him and asked, \"Are you created  or uncreated?\" ‘Abdul Karim ibn abu al-‘Awja’ answered, \" I am uncreated.\" The ‘Alim then  asked him, \"Describe for us then, how you might have been if you were created.\" ‘Abdal  Karim remained quiet and confused and began to scribble scrabble with a piece of wood,  saying, long, wide, deep, short, moving and motionless all these are the qualities of His  creatures.\" The ‘Alim (Imam) then said, \"If you do not know anything other than these as the  qualities of the creation then consider yourself a creature because that is what you find within  yourself that take place and come into existence.\" ‘Abdal Karim then said, \"You have asked  me a question that no one before had ever asked and no one ever would ask afterwards.\" Abu  ‘Abdallah then said, \"It is fine. I noticed that you did not ask any thing in the time past but  how would you know that you will not ask any thing in future? Besides, O ‘Abdal Karim,  what you said is against your notion that from the beginning all things are equal. How then  you made them before and after? The Imam then said, \"O ‘Abdal Karim let me explain it for  you. Suppose if you had a bag with you full of pearls and someone asked you, \"Is there a  Dinar in your bag?\" You then denied and said, \"No, there is no Dinar in my bag.\" The person  then said, \"Alright, then describe for me the qualities of the Dinar but you had no knowledge  of the qualities of the Dinar. Could you deny the existence of the Dinar that was from the bag  but you did not know about it?\" he replied, \"No, I would not deny.\" The Imam then said, \"The  world is bigger, taller and wider than a bag. Perhaps in the world there is a creature as such  that you do not know in whose case you would not be able to tell the qualities of the created  from the non-created.\" ‘Abdal Karim remained quiet but some of his people agreed to accept  Islam and a few of them remained. He came again to the meeting of the Imam on the third day and said, \"I like to reverse the question.\" The Imam replied, \"Ask whatever you like.\" He then asked, \"What is the proof that  bodies did not exist and then they came into existence?\" The Imam then said, \"I have not seen  anything small or large that on adding to it something of the same size would not make it  bigger and in this there is a change and transformation from the first condition. If it, however,  would have been eternal, there would have been no changing and transformation. What may  cease to exist or change it may come into existence and may get destroyed, thus, with its  existence after its none existence is entering into the state of coming into being and as being  eternal this will take it into nothingness but the two qualities of being eternal and nothingness  and the qualities of a contingent and something without a beginning in one thing do come  together.\" ‘Abdal Karim then said, \"Suppose, I noticed that with a view to the two conditions  you mentioned you considered it a proof of their contingency. If, however, things would   remain small, despite the addition, then how would you prove their contingency?\" The ‘Alim then said, \"We speak of this universe that is already there. Were we to take it away and place  another universe in its place nothingness would have, certainly, been a stronger proof of its  contingency than its removal and its replacing with a different one. I, however, will answer  you according to your assumption. If things would still remain small but it would certainly  come into one’s thinking that whenever something like it added to another thing it then would  be bigger. The fact that it can change is proof of its becoming temporal and in its changing  condition is proof of its contingency. There is nothing beyond it for you, O ‘Abdal Karim.  ‘Abdal Karim had nothing else to say.Next year he met the Imam (a.s.) in Makkah again and people from his followers said that ‘Abdal Karim has become a Muslim. The Imam told him that ‘Abdal Karim was blind in this  matter and would not become a Muslim. When he saw the ‘Alim he said, \"My master, my  chief!\" The ‘Alim then asked him, \"What brings you here?\" He then replied, \"It is the habits  of the body and the traditions of the town to see what craziness makes them shave and throw  pebbles.\" The ‘Alim said, \"It seems that you still live in your arrogance and misguidance, O  ‘Abdal Karim.\" He began to speak but the Imam said, \"Disputation during Hajj is not  permissible. The Imam freed his gown from the hand of the heretic man and said, \"If it is the  way you say and it is not true, then we as well as you are all saved. However, if it is the way  we say and it is true we are saved but you are destroyed.\" ‘Abdal Karim then turned to his  people saying, \"I feel pain in my heart. Take me back. They took him away and he died.",

I   then come to understand that for this establishment there must be a founder and then I acknowledge His existence.

After asking  permission that he was granted Hisham explained, \"Al-Daysani asked me a question today  and I see no one except Allah and yourself to answer it.\" The Imam then asked, \"What is the  question?\" Hisham restated the question that al-Daysani had asked. The Imam then said, \"O  Hisham, how many are your senses?\" He replied, \"They are five.\" The Imam then asked,  \"Which one is the smallest?\" He replied, \"The seeing sense.\" The Imam then asked, \"How big  is its size?\" He replied, \"It is about the size of the pupil or smaller.\" The Imam then said, \"O  Hisham, look in front of you and above you and then tell me what you have seen.\" Hisham  then replied, \"I can see the sky, the earth, the houses, the buildings, the land, the mountains  and the water canals.\" The Imam then said, \"The One who has been able to fit all that you can  see in a pupil or even a smaller thing is also able to fit the whole world in side an egg without  any change in the size of any one of them. Hisham bowed down and kissed the feet, the hands  and the head of the Imam (a.s.) saying, \"This is enough for me O descendant of the holy  Prophet and then left for his home. The next day al-Daysani met him and said, \"I have come  just to say greetings to you and not for an answer to my question\" Hisham then said, \"Even if  you may have come for an answer it is ready.\" Al-Daysani then left to meet Imam abu  ‘Abdallah (a.s.) and after asking permission for a meeting which was granted he sat down and  said, \"O Ja‘far ibn Muhammad, \"Guide me to my Lord.\" The Imam then asked, \"What is your  name?\" He then left without answering the Imam and his people asked him, \"Why did you not  answer the Imam?\" He replied, \"Were I to tell him that it is ‘Abdallah he would then ask that  who is this Lord whose slave are you?\" They then said, \"Return to him and ask him to guide  you to your Lord without asking your name.\" He then returned back to the Imam and asked,  \"O Ja‘far ibn Muhammad, \"Guide me to my Lord but do not ask my name.\" The Imam asked  him to sit down. A young boy, son of the Imam was there playing with an egg in his hand and  the Imam asked, \"Fetch me the egg O young man. The boy gave the egg to the Imam who  said, \"O Daysani, this is a secure castle. It has a thicker outer shell and inside of it there is  much finer shell inside of which there is liquid gold and flowing silver. The liquid gold does   not mix with the flowing silver nor does the flowing silver mix the liquid gold. Such is its condition no expert comes out therefrom to find out what is beneficial to it to report back all  about it nor any corrupting agent enters therein so that its problems would be reported. No  one knows if it is created for a male or a female. It will burst out with colors of a peacock. Do  you think there is someone to design and manage it?Al-Daysani thought quietly and said, \"I testify that there is no god but Allah Who is the only Lord and has no partner. I testify that Muhammad (s.a) is His servant and messenger and that  you are the Imam and an authority from Allah over his creatures and I repent because of  previous beliefs.\"",

"Content": "Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from ‘Abbass ibn ‘Amr al-Faqimi from Hisham ibn al-Hakam in the narration about the atheist who came to Imam abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) and  the Imam had explained to him the following.   \"You assume that there are two eternal and powerful powers (who control the universe) or  that both are weak or only one of them is weak and the other is powerful. If they both are  powerful why then neither one ever makes an effort to remove the other one so only one  would become in control of the universe? If you would assume that one is powerful and the  other is weak then it is proof that there is only one, as we believe because the weakness of the  other is so apparent. Besides, if you would say that they are two then they either agree with  each other in all matters or disagree in the same way. Since we see the creation works in an  organized manner, the orbiting objects continue to do so, the organization is one, the day, the  night, the sun and the moon all show that the organization is valid and correct. The harmony  in the matter shows that the organizer is One. If your claim of two would involve you to  believe that there must be a gap in between to show two things and in that case, the gap will  become a third one and eternal. Thus, it will involve you in three and this will involve to say  what you said about the two where you needed to have a gap and in this case it will become  five and so on indefinite in number and multiplicity.\" Hisham has said that of the questions of the atheist from Imam abu ‘Abdallah one was that what is the evidence of His existence? The Imam (a.s.) answered, \"The existence of the  effects (activities) show that someone has produced those effects and activities. Consider,  when you see a well constructed building you learn that there is someone, who has built it  even if you have not seen the builder with your own eyes.\" The atheist then asked, \"What is it  then?\" The Imam replied, \"He is something but different from all things. I repeat my  statement that speaks about Him as a thing. He is a thing in the sense of the reality of things  except that He does not have a body and form. He does not have a feeling (like our sense of  feeling) or touching and He does not comprehend with the five senses (as we do).   Imaginations can not comprehend Him and the timeless (Dahr) times does not reduce Him and the times do not change Him.\"",

He does not have a feeling (like our sense of feeling) or  touching and He does not comprehend with the five senses (as we do).

He Himself hears and He Himself sees. My saying \"He hears without a hearing organ  and sees without a means. He Himself hears and He Himself sees\" does not mean that He is a  thing and His-self is another thing but that I only meant to express my self thereby as I was  questioned and explained to you as you had asked a question. Thus, I can say that He hears  with the whole of His-self but not in the sense that His whole self has parts but that I intended  to explain it to you and to express my self. All I meant thereby is that He does hear, see and  He is all-knowing and is the expert in knowing without any multiplicity in His-self or  meaning.The man asking questions then said, \"What then is He?\" The Imam said, \"He is the Lord. He is the One Who is worshipped and He is Allah. When I say Allah, it does not mean  establishing the proof for these letters (of alphabet) like Alif, Lam, Ha’, al-Ra’ or al-Ba’ but I  intend thereby the meaning of a thing and a thing that is the Creator of all things and the   Designer of all things. These letters only refer to the meaning that is called Allah, al-Rahman (the Beneficent), al-Rahim (the Merciful), al-‘Aziz (the Majestic) etc., of the other such  names and He is the One Who is worshipped, the Majestic, the Glorious One.\"The man asking questions then said, \"Given the above, whatever we can think of is but a creature.\" The Imam then said, \"Were it to the way you said we would not have had any  responsibility to believe in the Oneness of the Creator because we will not have any  responsibility towards something of whose existence we can not even think of. In fact we say  that whatever is thought of in our senses is comprehended thereby by means of drawing limits  around it and is analogized, thus, such a thing is a creature. (It then becomes necessary for us  to find proof for the existence of the Creator of things.(We must find that is) clear of the two  invalid and confusing aspects) if the meaning of negation would be nullification and  nothingness or as is the case of the second aspect, the similarity and analogy which is of the  attributes of the creatures that under go manifest composition and assemblage. It becomes  necessary to prove the existence of the Creator. It is because of the existence of the creatures  and their evident dependency on Him as His creatures and that their Creator is something  other than them and that He is not similar to them because something similar to them would  resemble them in manifest composition and assemblage. It would be as such also in the  matters such as coming into existence from nothing and their changing from a smaller size to  a full grown size, from blackness to whiteness from strength to weakness and other existing  conditions that we do not need to explain their existence.\"The man asking questions then said, \"You have already defined and limited Him in your proving His existence.\" The Imam (a.s.) then said, \"I did not limit Him. I only proved His  existence if (as you think) there is no difference between proving and disproving.\"The man asking questions then said, \"Can His existence be proved through a reasoning from the effect to the cause or the cause to the effect?\"The Imam said, \"Yes, there is nothing whose existence can be proved without adopting either of the two above process of reasoning.\"The man then asked, \"Does the question how apply to Him?\" The Imam said, \"No, this question does not apply to Him because it is the aspect of qualities and limitations. However,  it is necessary to avoid abandoning and analogizing Him because negating Him is denying  His existence and refusing to accept Him as the Lord and abandoning Him altogether.  Whoever would analogize Him with other things from His creatures he has proved the  qualities of the creature in Him, the creatures that do not deserve being called the Lord. It,  however, is necessary to believe that the question how applies to Him only in a way that  would not apply to things other than Him and things other than Him would not deserve and  share Him in it. The how question can not apply to Him if it would limit Him or make Him  the subject of knowing for others.\"  The man then asked, \"Do things make Him tired?\" The Imam then said, \"He is far Exalted and above experiencing such conditions. Such conditions are due to coming into physical  association or dealing with the creatures. They are of the qualities of the creatures who can  only associate with others through physical contact but He is the Most High and His will and  demand are effective and He does whatever He wants.\"",

He did not have any coming into  existence and nor there was any being for His coming into being. This does not apply to Him  because He is not subject to the effects of space. He was not in any thing or on any thing nor  did He invent any space for His own space. He did not become stronger after making all  things nor was weak before giving being to the beings. He was not lonely before His  inventing all things. He is not similar to any thing that could be called a thing. He was also  not without Kingdom before the creation and nor will He be without it after all things. He  lives eternally without life and the powerful king before His invention of the things and He is  an all powerful king after the creation of all things. To His existence no How or Where  question is applicable. There is no limit for Him nor is He definable by analogy. He does not  become old due to eternal living. He doe not become alarmed because of any thing but that all  things are fearful of His (disappointment). He lived without newly emerging life. He is not a  describable being or that could be limit with conditions or that would have a space to depend  on. He does not have a place so that He can be considered as neighboring something. He is  living and one can know Him. He is the eternal King. He has the power and the kingdom. He  has created all that He wanted and when He decided by His will. He can not be limited. He  can not be divided or destroyed. He was before everything but no How question would apply  to Him. He will be the last but no Where will apply to Him. All things will be destroyed  except He. The creation belongs to Him and His is the command. He is the Holy Lord of the  worlds. O inquirer, imaginations can not encompass my Lord and He does not face any  confusions or bewilderment. Nothing is able to escape Him and nothing happens to Him. He  can not be held responsible for anything and He does not become regretful. Neither slumber  nor sleep overcomes Him. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth  and all that is between them and under the soil.",

Is it is possible to see Allah’s self with one’s own eyes as is traditionally narrated  in the affirmative by the Sunni Muslims (al-'ammah) and the Shi‘ah Muslims (al-khassah)  who are contrary.

It is the form of knowledge that  does not require logical proofs. If it is true that seeing Allah’s self with the eyes is possible  then it becomes a necessity to acknowledge that Allah becomes entirely known and defined  through eye-witnessed process. Now, can eye-witnessed knowledge of Allah’s self be  considered faith or not? If the knowledge of Him as such, i.e. eye-witnessed knowledge  (which according to Sunni Muslims will happen on the Day of resurrection) be considered  faith, then faith in Allah in this world, which comes through non-eye-witnessed knowledge is  not faith. It is contrary to eye-witnessed knowledge and faith (contrary things do not exist at  the same time). Thus, there would be no one who would have faith in Allah in this world  because no one has seen Him, Majestic is Whose name.   If the eye-witnessed knowledge and understanding would not be considered faith then the non-eye-witnessed faith and knowledge formed and acquired must go away in the next life, but, in  fact, it will not go away on the Day of resurrection.

"Content": "Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from some of his people from Hisham ibn al-Hakam who has said the following.  \"Things can be perceived by two means: (1) By the senses and (2) by the heart, intellect. Perceptions of the senses are of three kinds: (1) Perception in the form of penetration, (2) Perception in the form of touching, and (3)  Perception without penetration or touch. Perception by means of sounds, smells and tastes are  formed through penetration. Perception through touching comes from the knowledge of  shapes, such as rectangular or triangular etc., and also softness, hardness, heat and cold.  Perception without touch or penetration is that of sight which is capable of perceiving things  without touching or penetration, directly or indirectly. Perception through sight needs a path  and medium. Its path is air and its medium is the light. If the path is continuous between the  viewer and the object and the medium then seeing takes place such as colors and persons. If  light falls on something without a path, it will return reflecting what is behind (the observed),  like an observer looking into a mirror. Light does not penetrate into the mirror, because it  finds no path. So it returns reflecting what lies behind the observed. It is similar to looking  into the clear water returns light that reflects what is at the rear. This happens because there is  no path for the penetration of light.Intellect dominates the air. It perceives all that is in the air and forms his Wahm (intuitive form of perception). If the heart will not find any thing in the air it comes back and reflects  what is in the air. A person of reason should not force his heart against what is not in the air  of the issue of the Oneness of Allah, the Majestic, the Glorious, otherwise, it will form his  Wahm of what is there in the air as mentioned about the eye-witnessing. Allah, the Most High  is far and above similarities with the creatures.\"",

"Content": "A group of our people has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid from his father from ibn abu ‘Umayr from ibn ’Udhaynah from Muhammad ibn Muslim from abu ‘Abdallah  (a.s.) who has said, \"The will is created.\"  Summery Statements on the Attributes of His selfSifat al-Dhat and the Attributes of His Actions Sifat al-Fi‘1For every two attributes which you attribute to Allah (e.g. The Creator, The Sustainer), of which each has its own separate being, (i.e. The Creator achieves its being, as an attribute of  Allah' through something which Allah creates, and The Sustainer achieves its being, as an  attribute of Allah, through a created being which He sustains), these attributes are attributes of  (His) action. (Because if two attributes are separate in being, obviously each of them differs in  their being with the thing with which they are attributed, and therefore both the attribute and  the attributed have their own being. Therefore, in order to distinguish an attribute of action from an attribute of essence, it is always necessary to compare that attribute with another one. If we perceives these two to be  independent of each other in being, then both of them are attributes of action). The  explanation (and proof) of this sentence is that you prove (establish), in respect of His Being,  what He intends to do and what He does not intend, what pleases Him and what displeases  Him, what He likes and what He dislikes. If the intention had been the attribute of His essence  like the attribute of knowledge and power, His not intending (for something) would have been  its contradiction. Similarly, if His liking for something had been the attribute of His essence,  His dislike (of something) would have been its contradiction. Do you not see, we do not find  in His Being anything which He does not know and anything over which He has no power?  Such are the attributes of His essence (Self), which are everlasting. We can never attribute to  Allah power and (its opposite) weakness. (Similarly, we can neither attribute to Him  knowledge and [its opposite] ignorance and stupidity, nor can we attribute to Him wisdom  and 1 its opposite] error. Nor can we attribute to Him honor and [its opposite] disgrace). It is  permissible to say, \"He (Allah) loves him who obeys Him and hates him who disobeys Him.  He favors him who obeys Him and is hostile to him who disobeys Him. And verily, He is  pleased and He is also displeased. It is also permissible to say in the invocations: ‘O my  Allah, be pleased with me and do not be angry at me. Favor me and do not be hostile to me.’\"  But it is not permissible to say, \"Allah has power to know and has no power not to know. He has power to possess and has no power not to possess. He has power to be powerful and wise,  and has no power to be otherwise, i.e. without power and wisdom. He has power to be  generous and has no power to be not generous. He has power to be forgiving and has no  power to be not forgiving.\" It is also not permissible to say, \"Allah intended to be the  Nourishing, the Everlasting, the Mighty, the Wise, the Possessor, the all-knowing, the all- Powerful.\" Since these are the attributes of His essence while intention is among His  attributes of action.\"Do you not see that it is said; \"Allah intended this and did not intend that.\" Every Attribute of His essence negates its opposite in respect of Him. He is called: \"The Living, the All- knowing, the All-hearing, the All-seeing, the All-mighty, the All-wise, the Rich, the King, the  Clement, the Just and the Generous.\" The opposite of knowledge is ignorance. The opposite  of power is inability. The opposite of life is death. The opposite of honor is humiliation. The  opposite of wisdom is error. The opposite of clemency is haste and ignorance. The opposite of  justice is oppression and tyranny. (So, by proving any of His essential attributes its opposite is  negated.)???",

"Content": "Ali ibn Muhammad has narrated from Salih ibn abu Hammad from al-Husayn ibn Yazid from al-Hassan ibn Ali ibn abu Hamzah from Ibrahim ibn ‘Umar from abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.), who  has said the following.   \"Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, created a name with letters that had no sound. He  created it with the word that would not be spoken. He created it with a personality that had no  body. It had a similarity that is not described. He created it with color that is colorless.  Diameters were negated from it. Limitations were distanced away from it. The feel of all  Mutawahhim (intuitive sense) is curtained from it. It is hidden but not covered. He placed it to  be a perfect word consisting of four parts together. No one of them is before the other. From  these He made public only three names because people desperately needed them. One of them  is kept out of public sight. This is the protected and treasured name.The names that became public is Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High. He, the Most Glorious, for each of these made four subservient key elements that formed twelve key  elements. Then for each key element He created thirty key elements to indicate an action  ascribed to the four key elements.He, therefore, is Al-Rahman (The All compassionate); al-Rahim (The All merciful); al-Malik (The King); al-Quddus (The Holy); al-Khaliq (The Creator); al-Bari’ (The Maker); al- Musawwir (The Fashioner); al-Hayy (The Ever living); al-Qayyum (The Self-subsistent).  Neither slumber nor sleep seizes Him. Al-’Alim (The All-knowing); al-Khabir (The All- aware); as-Sami‘ (The All-hearing); al-Basir (The All-seeing); al-Hakim (The All-wise);  al-‘Aziz (The All-Majestic); al-Jabbar (The All-compeller); al-Mutakabbir (The All-  sublime); al-‘Aliyy (The Most High); al-‘Azim (The All-Great); al-Muqtadir (The All- Dominant); al-Qadir (The All-capable); Al-Salam (The All peaceable); al-Mu’min (The All- protector); al-Muhaymin (The All-preserver); al-Munshi’ (The All-inventor) al-Badi‘ (The  All-originator); al-Rafi‘ (The Exalter); al-Jalil (The Majestic); al-Karim (The Generous); al- Raziq (The All-provider); al-Muhyi (The Bestower of Life); al-Mumit (The Inflictor of death);  al-Ba‘ith (The Resurrector); al-Warith (The Inheriter).  These names in addition to the (Asma’ al-Husna) beautiful names make them three hundred sixty names. Such is the ratio of these three names. These three names are key element names.  Only one name is kept out of public sight, protected and treasured with these three names.  Thus, Allah has said, \"Say, call Allah or al-Rahman. Call whichever you call. For Him there  are beautiful names. (17:110)???from each were . I by letter, nor expressed by word, nor manifested by baby, nor indicated by similitude, nor emblazoned by colour. Negated from Annit are all dimensions, removed from  it all limits, inaccessible is it to the sensations of every sensate being, and veiled is it without  any veil. Allah made it one all comprehensive Word, with four constituents contiguous,  immediate, without one being after the other. Three out of the four were made manifest, since  creation was most in need of them, and one has been concealed, the ineffable, the occult  Name. Of the (three) Names that have been made manifest, their manifestation is Allah'—the  Hallowed, the Exalted. To each one of these (three) Names, Allah, the Exalted, subordinated  four 'Supports'. Thus, they have all become twelve 'supports' in number. Then Allah created  thirty Names in respect of every support according to (His different) actions. These names  are: Al-Rahman (The All-compassionate); ar-Rahim (The All-merciful); al-Malik (The Lord);  al-Quddus (The All-holy); al-Khiliq (The Creator); al-B\u0026ri' ( The Maker); al-Musawwir (The  Fashioner); al-.Hayy (The Ever living); al-Qayyam (The Selfsubsistent); 'Whom slumber  seize Him not, neither sleep'; al- !41im ( The All-knowing); al-Khabur ( The All-aware); as- Sami ' ( The Allhearing); al-Basir (The All-seeing); al-Hakim (The All-wise); al-\u003elziz (The  All-mighty); al-Jabbar (The All-compeller); al-Mutakabbir (The All-sublime); al-Aliyy (The  All-high); al-!Azim (The All-glorious); al-Muqtadir ( The All-omnipotent); al-Qddir ( The  All-powerful); as-Saldm (The All-peaceable); al-Mu'min (The All-faithful); al-Muhaymin  (The All-preserver); al-Munshi' (The All-evolver) al-Badi' (The All-originator);ar-Rafi' (The  Exalter);al-Jalil (The Majestic);al-Karim (The Generous); ar-R§ziq (The All-sustainer); al- MuRyi (The Bestower of Life); al-Mumit (The Inflictor of death); al-Ba'ith (The Resurrector);  al-W6rith (The Inheriter).\"These names along with the other Beautiful and Good Names come to a total of three hundred and sixty names. They all branch forth from the original three which are the three  supports. And that one ineffable occult name became concealed through these three names.  This is what Allah, the Sublime, has said, 'Say, call upon Allah, or call upon 'ar-Rahmdn' (the  Compassionate); whichsoever you call upon, to Him (alone) belongs the name most  Beautiful. ' (al-Isrd', 17: 110)\"??? Al-‘Allamah al-Majlisi has said the following about the above Hadith, \"Among its narrators, there are unknown people. The Hadith itself is not clear. Its meaning is an indefinable secret.   No one knows its interpretation except Allah and those firmly rooted in knowledge. Therefore, to remain silent in its interpretation and to confess failure in understanding its  meaning is most righteous, worthwhile and suitable to precaution. (Mir’at al-‘uqul, vol.2,  p.24)??",

He is only One and One  alone. How can one form a belief in His Oneness by thinking that one may know Him  through things other than Him. One comes to know Allah only by Allah His Own self. One  who can not know Him by His Own self he has not known Him. He only comes to know  some thing else. There is nothing between the Creator and the created.

If you  say that they are His Own Self, meaning that He has plurality and multiplicity, then Allah is  far exalted from being as such. If you mean that names and attributes of Allah had eternally  been there, this also has a double meaning. (Firstly) if you mean, that names and attributes  have eternally been in the knowledge of Allah and He eternally deserved them, it is true and  quite right. If you mean that the letters, pictures, spellings and syllables of names and  attributes were eternal, then we seek refuge from Him against such belief. Allah existed but  there were no creatures. He created names and attributes as a means between His Own-self  and the creatures. Through these means they pray to Him and ask Him for help and names are  the means to speak of Him. Allah existed without being mentioned. The One mentioned  through names is Allah the eternal, Who will be there eternally. Names and attributes are  created their meaning and what they indicate is Allah, Who is far above plurality and  combination, which happens only to the moving things. You can not say that Allah is  compiled. He is a great deal or very little. He His Own-self is eternal. What is other than the  Only One, it is divisible. Allah is not divisible. Not even in one’s imaginations He can be  though of as more or less. Every divisible or being thought of as less or more, in one’s   imagination, is created which is the sign of the existence of the Creator. When you say Allah has power you in reality say that He does not become frustrated due to weakness. In this way  you negate weakness from Him and consider it other than Him. The same is the meaning of  your saying that He is all knowing. With this, you negate ignorance from Him and have  considered it other than Him. When Allah will destroy all things the form, spelling and  syllables will all be destroyed. Allah is and will eternally be there.\"The man then said, \"Why do we call our Lord All-hearing? The Imam said, \"Because every thing that can be heard is not hidden from Him. We do not ascribe to Him the hearing ability  that exists in the heads. In the same way we call Him All-seeing. It is because every thing that  can be seen like colors or individuals etc., are not hidden from Him. We do not call Him All- seeing because of blinking eye. In the same way we call Him Subtle because of His  knowledge of delicate things such as insects, etc., or even more delicate things. (It is because  of His knowledge of) that, wherefrom such things emerge and of the intelligence, desires for  reproduction, compassion for their offspring, their guarding each other, their carrying food  and drink to their offspring in the mountains, wilderness, valleys and desolate places. From  this we know that their Creator is Subtle but without the condition of subtlety. Such  conditions are for the creatures, who are conditioned with conditions.We also call our Lord powerful but not because of the aggressiveness that the creatures display. If so, there a similarity would have existed as well as degrees of decrease that would  involve increases. Whatever would decrease is not eternal and is weak. To our Lord, the Most  Holy, the Most High, no one is similar, no contrary, no resemblance, no conditions, no end  and no seeing of eyes. It is unlawful for the hearts to analogize Him. It is unlawful for the  Awham (intuitive power) to limit Him. It is unlawful for one’s consciousness to contain Him.

Allah is One and a man is one. Are the two not  similar in oneness?\" The Imam replied, \"O Fath, you said something impossible. May Allah  grant you steadfastness. Similarity is in meaning. In the case of names they are all the same.  The names refer to the nominee. When it is said a man it, at the same time, is a report about  one body and not two bodies. In fact, man is not one thing. His parts, colors and the color of  his colors that consist of distinct parts, that are not equal. His blood is different from his flesh.  His nerves are different from his vines, his hairs are different from his skin. The black things  in him are different from the white things therein. The same is true of all other creatures.

Human beings are created, designed,  compounded of different parts and various substances. Only when combined becomes one.\"  I then said, \"May Allah take my soul in service for your cause, and grant you happiness, would you explain to me the meaning of your words \"Subtle and All-aware? Explain it as you  just did with the One? I know that His Subtlety or kindness is different from those of His  creatures but I like more clarity.\" The Imam said, \"O Fath, we said He is Subtle it is because  of His knowledge of the delicate creatures, may Allah give you success and steadfastness, so  you should consider His creation. Consider His design in delicate and not so delicate plants  and other creatures like animals, small and large such as flies and cricket and smaller ones  that even eyes can not. Because of their small size no one knows which is male and which is  female, which is new born and which is old. We find tremendously delicate things with signs  of His Subtlety, in their desire for reproduction, running away from death, collecting what is  good for them and what is in the depth of the oceans and on the barks of trees, in the  wilderness and desolate places. We find more fastidiousness in such animals and their ability  to communicate with each other, and what their offspring understand from them, their  transporting food to their young and their colors, red along with yellow, white along with red  so fine that our eyes are not able to catch for their very exquisite shape. Our eyes are not able  to see them and our hands are not able to touch them. All these show that the Creator of all  such marvelous creatures are Subtle Who is kind to all the creatures we mentioned. He has  done it without instruments and means. Every designer and manufacturer builds and  manufactures some thing from something but Allah does it from nothing.\"",

"Content": "It is narrated from Ali ibn Muhammad, in a mursal manner, from abu al-Hassan al-Rida (a.s.) who has said the following to one of his followers.  \"May Allah, bestow up on you knowledge of the good, notice that Allah, the Most Holy, the  Most High, is eternal. Eternity is that attribute which guides the wise that there was nothing  before Him in eternity nor is there anything with Him eternal. That this attribute is a  miraculous one has come to light from the acknowledgement of the ‘Ammah (common  people) that there is nothing before Allah, with and after Him. At the same time, it invalidates  the belief that there was something before or with Him. Had there been something with Him  eternal He would not have been the Creator of that thing. If it was with Him how then He  could have been its creator? Had there been something before Him then that thing might have  been His creator because of its existing earlier. Allah, the Most Holy, the Exalted, has ascribed certain names to Himself. He told His creatures when He created them, give them the ability to worship Him and made them  responsible, to call Him with those names. He called Himself All-hearing, All-seeing, All- powerful, Guarding, Rationalizing, Manifest, Hidden, Subtle, All-aware, Powerful, Majestic,  Wise, All-knowing and with such other similar names. When the animosity-mongers, who  speak lies heard us mention such names as that there is nothing similar to Him and nothing of  the creatures is like Him they began to speak out. \"When you (the Imams (a.s.) say that there   is nothing like Him and no one is similar to Him then how is it that you also have those beautiful names for yourselves? This is proof that you are similar to Him or in certain  conditions and not in other conditions because of having all those beautiful names.\" It is said  to them that Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, made it necessary for His servants to have  certain names from among His names with differences in their meanings. The difference is  because one name may have two different meanings. One example is what people consider  permissible and is widely used. This is the way Allah has addressed people. He has spoken to  them by means of things that they understand so that they will have no excuse in their  misdeeds.A man is sometimes called a dog, a bull, sweet, bitter and a loin. All these are different from him and his conditions. The names were not used in their original meaning because man is not  a loin or a dog etc. Note this carefully, may Allah grant you blessings.Allah is called All-knowing. It is other than the created knowledge. With His knowledge of things He knows things and uses it to preserve His future commands and the process of  whatever He creates of His creatures, destroys what He destroys of His creatures and without  such knowledge He would have been weak and ignorant. We see that people of knowledge  among people are called knowledgeable because of the created knowledge, which they did  not have at one time. Perhaps such knowledge may go away from them and they become  ignorant. Allah is called All-knowing because He is not ignorant of anything. Thus, the Creator and created are both called as having knowledge but the meaning is different as you may have  noticed.Our Lord is called All-hearing but it is not through the perforated piece and with sound so He would hear with it but would not see with it, which is the case with us. We do not see with  what we hear but Allah has told us that from Him nothing of the sounds is hidden. His hearing  is not in the way we are called as hearing people. We are called as hearing but the meaning is  different. In the same way is seeing not that He sees through a hole as we do and can not use  it for other uses. Allah sees but not by looking to an object. We also are called as seeing but  the meaning is different.Allah is called Standing but not in the sense of standing in an upright position on the legs as is the case with the things but that He has said He is preserving as in the saying of a man,  \"standing for our affairs.\" Allah stands over every soul and what it gains. The word standing  is also in the usage of people. Words like remaining and standing also mean to suffice as in  the words as you may say to a man, \"Stand up over the affairs of so and so\" which means deal  with them in a sufficient manner. We stand on our legs, thus, the name is similar but the  meaning is different.  The name, Subtle is not in the sense of fastidiousness or being infinitesimal but it is in the rarity and hard to perceive nature of things. As an example it may be said, \"It has become  very delicate for me and that so and so is very delicate in his manners and dealings.\" This  means that it is profound for intelligence and difficult to find. It has become bottomless and  delicate so much that even imagination is not able to reach it. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most  High, is far Subtle to be comprehended through definitions or be combined in an attribute or  in the way we are subtle, small and delicate. Names are the same but different in meaning.The name al-Khabir, meaning All-aware, is for One Who knows all things completely but not by means of experience and learning lessons from the past. Experience and learning from  mistakes are of the means of learning for people. Without them there would exist no  knowledge. One without experience and learning lessons is an ignorant person. Allah is All- aware eternally of what He has created but well aware and expert among people are those  who ask questions and learn. Our names are the same but they, again, are different in meaning.The name al-Zahir meaning clear and conspicuous is not because of being over and on top of all things or sitting on them at their peak but it is because of His domination and having  power over all things. An example of this is when a person says, \"I over came my enemies or  that Allah gave me victory over my enemies.\" In this there is report of the failure and victory.  Also there is Allah’s domination over all things. Another example is that His existence is  clear for those who want (to know) Him. Nothing is hidden from Him and that He is the  guardian of all that He has curved and fashioned. In such case whose existence can be clearer  than Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High? You will not live without His creatures, no matter  wherever you may be. Only within your own self there is enough of His creation. His  existence by far is clearer than ours. He manifest all by His Own-self and is Known by His  own self. We are of the same name but the meaning is different.The name al-Batin, means hidden. This is not in the sense of being inside of things by means of diving or so but is in the sense of His dealing, having knowledge, preserving and regulating  the inside of all things. As one may say, \"I tried to find the inside to learn and discover the  secrets.\" Hidden for us is what is unseen and covered. In this case again our names are the  same but different in meaning.The name al-Qahir, means subduing. It is not in the sense of plotting, using certain devices and speaking attractive words or cunning means. It is not the way people subdue each other.  The victorious among people may become subdued and vice versa. For Allah, the Most Holy,  the Most High all the creatures have the garment of weakness on them. Due to the absence of  obstacles in what He wills about them, it only takes less than a blinking of the eye to say it Be  and it is, comes into existence. Subduing in our case is how I mentioned and explained. Our  names are alike but the meaning is different. Thus, is the case for all the names although we  have not mentioned all of them. For learning a lesson what we have mentioned for you is  sufficient. May Allah be your and our helper in the matters of guidance and success.\"",

Al-Samad  literally means solid as opposed to hallow which applies only to physical objects. Allah, the  Most High, is far above such attributes. Had such attribute applied to Allah, the Most High, it  would have contradicted with Allah’s statement that says, \"There is nothing similar to Him.\" In the Ahadith of the scholar, the Imam (a.s.) al-Samad refers to a master whom people consider a recourse or stronghold and such meaning is close to Allah’s words, \"There is  nothing similar to Him.\" (42:11)  An example of such usage is what abu Talib had expressed in praise of the holy Prophet (s.a.) during his performing Hajj in throwing pebbles onto the pillars of stones that symbolically  stand for Satan. He has used the word al-Samad to mean aiming.An other example is found in the expression of ibn Zabarqan, \"Mr Rahibah is but a master and a (al-Samad) recourse.\"One more example can be found in the expression of Shaddad ibn Mu‘awiyah about Kudhayfah ibn Badr, \"Hold it O Hudhayfa, you are a master, ( al-Samad) recourse.\" There are  many such examples in normal usage.Allah, the Majestic, the Most High, the Master and the Recourse to Who all man and Jinn turn for help in their difficulties and from Him they expect relief.",

Be very  careful about the attributes of Allah to have a belief about them that would limit Him through  increase or reduction, moving or being moved, removal or His coming down, standing up or  sitting down.

Does He carry the ‘Arsh or ‘Arsh carries Him?\" Imam Ali (a.s.) replied,  \"Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, is the One Who carries and has lifted the ‘Arsh, the  heavens and earth and all that is between them from banishment. ‘Allah (God) prevents the  heavens and the earth from falling apart. If they do fall apart, then, no one besides Him can  restore them. He is All-forbearing and All-forgiving. (35:41)’ He then asked, \"Tell me about  His words, ‘The angels will be around the heavens and on that day eight of them will carry  the Throne of your Lord above all the creatures (69:17).’ \"How has He said it. You just said  that He carries the heavens, earth and all that is between them.\" Asked the man. Amirul  Mu’minin then said, \"Allah, the Most High, created al-‘Arsh (the Throne) from four lights.  From a red wherefrom the redness became red, a green light from which the greenness  became green, a yellow light whereby the yellowness became yellow. He created it from a  white light wherefrom is white and it is knowledge which Allah has made the carriers to carry  and that is the light of His greatness. With His greatness and His light He has given sight to  the hearts of believers. Because of His greatness and light the ignorant ones have become His  enemies. Through His greatness and light all those in heavens and on earth, all His creatures  seek to reach Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, by means of their various deeds and  mixed religions. All that is carried Allah carries them with the light of His greatness and  power. They are not able to do any benefit, or harm, death or life or resurrection. All things  are carried. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, preserves them from banishment and has  control over both of them (heavens and earth). He is the life of all things, the light of all  things. Glorious is He, the Most High, far above what they say about Him. He is far high  above them with Greatness.\" He then said tell me about Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, where is He? Amirul Mu’minin said, \"He is here. He is there, above, below, encompassing us and with us as He  has said. ‘There is not a single place wherein any secret counsel can take place between any  three people without God being the fourth, nor five people without His being the sixth nor any  gathering of more or less people, wherever it may be, without His being with them . . .’   (58:7).

He does not experience fatigue in preserving them both. He is the High, and the  Greatest.’ (2:255) Thus, those who carry al-‘Arsh (the throne) are the scholars whom Allah  has made to carry His knowledge. There is nothing that Allah has created in the heavens and  the earth that is out of these four that He has shown to those whom he chosen. He showed  them to His friend Ibrahim (s.a.). \"Also, We showed (Abraham) the kingdom of the heavens  and the earth to strengthen his faith.\" (6:75) How would the carriers of al-‘Arsh (the Throne)  carry Allah when with life from Him their hearts receive life and with His light they found  guidance to know Him.\"",

I requested the Imam (a.s.) to meet him and he agreed. Abu Qurrah asked the Imam  about the lawful and unlawful matters and then said, \"Do you affirm that Allah is carried?\"  Imam abu al-Hassan (a.s.) replied, \"Every thing in an objective case is related to another thing  and is dependent. Being carried is the name for verbal defect. On the other hand, carrier is in a  subjective case and it verbally is a word to convey praises and so is the expression of one who  says, \"Above, below, upper and lower.\" Allah has said, ‘For Him there are beautiful names,  thus, call Him through those names.’ He (Allah) has not said anywhere in His books that He  is al-Mahmul (Being carried) He has, in fact, said that He is the carrier in the sea and on land  and the preserver of the heavens and earth from banishment. Al-Mahmul, (being carried) are  things other than Allah. It is never heard from any one who believed in Allah and His  greatness saying in his prayers Ya Mahmul, (O the one being carried,).\" Abu Qurrah then said,  \"He Himself has said, ‘The angels will be around the heavens and on that day eight of them  will carry the Throne of your Lord above all the creatures.’ (69:17) Also He has said, \"Those  who carry the Throne (al-‘Arsh).\" Imam abu al-Hassan (a.s.) then said, \"Al-‘Arsh (the  Throne) is not Allah. Al-‘Arsh is the name of knowledge and power. In al-‘Arsh there is  everything. Besides, He has ascribed carrying to things other than His Own-self. It is ascribed  to a creature among His creatures. This is because He has made His creatures to worship Him  through carrying His al-‘Arsh (the Throne) and they are the carrier of His knowledge. There  is a creature, who speaks of His praise around His al-‘Arsh (the Throne) and act according to  His knowledge and the angels write down the deeds of His servants. He has made those on  earth to worship Him in the form of Tawaf (walking around) His house. Allah has control  over al-‘Arsh (the Throne) as He has said, \"Allah carries al-‘Arsh, those who carry it and  those around it, preserves them, keeps them together and is the guardian of all souls and  above and over all things.\" It is not permissible to say, \"He is carried. He is below.\" It would   be the only expression that would not make any sense. Thus, both the word and meaning would be destroyed.\" Abu Qurrah than said, \"Do you then consider a false Hadith the Hadith  that says, \"When Allah becomes angry His anger becomes known to the angels who carry  al-‘Arsh. They at such time feel the weight of His anger on their shoulders. They then bow  down in prostration. When Allah’s anger goes away it becomes light and the angels return to  their places.\" Imam abu al-Hassan (a.s.) said, \"Tell me about Allah, the Most Holy, the Most  High. From the time He condemned Satan until today is He not angry with Satan? When did  He become happy with Satan? As you say He is still angry with Satan, his friend and  followers. How would you dare speak of your Lord as under going changes from one  condition to another condition and that what happens to the creatures happens to Him also. He  is the Most Glorious, the Most High. He does not banish with those who banish and does not  change with those who change. He is not replaced with those who are replaced. The creatures  are under His guardianship and they all are dependent on Him. He is Self-sufficient and  independent of others.\"",

He is the power. With His  power He is distinct from others and the other things became manifest through His power.  There is no attribute that would reach Him and He has no limit for a definition or an analogy.  All the linguistic beauty and expressions fall far short to express His attributes. In speaking of  Him all attributes prove to be misleading. The depth of the schools of thoughts are perplexed  and confused about the wonders of His kingdom. All the comprehensive interpretations have  remained far short of establishing any footing in His knowledge. The barriers of the unseen  have curtained His treasured secrets. The high flying ambitious intelligence with the ability to  reach the depth of very subtle matters lose their way at the very beginning of their journey to  Him. Most Holy is Allah. To Him not even the far-reaching ambitions are able to reach. No  deep diving intelligence is able to comprehend Him. Most High is He Who is not subject to  the effects of any calculated time or extended period or limited attributes. Glorious is He Who  has no beginning for His start, a destination to approach or an end to diminish. Glorious is He  Who is just the way He Himself has introduced. All those who speak of His praise can never  praise fully and duly. He designed a limit for everything at the time He created them. It is  because that there is no similarity between them and He and that because He is not similar to  any thing else. He is not absolved in anything so that it could be said He is within anything  and He is far from anything so that it could be said He has nothing to do with them (the  creatures). He has not distanced Himself from them so that it can be said where is He? He is  far Glorious (and above such associations). He has encompassed all things through His  knowledge. He has made their design firm and has enumerated them for safe preservation.  Even the unseen and hidden things in the air, is not unnoticed to Him. Nor things deeply  hidden in the darkness of black nights, all things high above in heavens and down to the  lowest earth are not unnoticed to Him. For everything there is a protector and a guard and  everything therein has limits within something and a limit for that limit.  He is the One, the only One, the self sufficient, Who is not subject to the changes due to times. The creation of things never over burdens Him. He only, when willing, commands it to  exist (and it comes into existence). He invented whatever He has created without any  examples to follow and without feeling of over burdened or exhaustion. All manufacturers  manufacture things from something. Allah has not created whatever He has created from  anything. Every knowledgeable one learns after being ignorant. He has not being ignorant and  has not learned from any one. He has encompassed all things through His knowledge before  their coming into existence and their existence has not increased any thing to His knowledge.  He knew them before their coming into existence just as He knows them after their coming  into existence. He did not bring them into existence to strengthen His authority or for fear of  banishment or reduction. He did not bring them into existence as helpers against a competing  opponent, and a peer who would be of more (power) or a partner who would show greatness.  He created them as creatures that required preservation and protection as subdued servants.Glorious is He, Who does not become tired in the creation of what He has created or the preservation of all that He has formed into beings. He does not undergo in this work any  weakness or exhaustion. Whatever He has created has deemed it sufficient. He knows what  He has created and created what He knew. It did not happen as a result of new thinking that  He found to be a correct one not because of some doubts that He may have found in whatever  that He had not yet created. It is due His unchangeable decree, His firm knowledge and  resolute command. He is the One only Lord and is very special in His Oneness. He is pure in  His Glory and praise. He is the only one in Oneness, the Glory, in Highness, in Oneness in  praiseworthiness and in Glory and Gloriousness. He is Far High above having children. He is  far Holy and clean above involvement in touching women and by far Majestic and Glorious  above the association of the partners. In whatever He has created there is nothing to oppose  Him nor there is any thing in what He created to stand parallel to Him and no one shares Him  His kingdom. He the One and only the Self-sufficient, Who brings the timeless time to an  end, is the owner of the extended duration of time. He is the one Who is eternal with eternal  Oneness before the beginning of the times and after all the changes in the creation. He is the  one who never banishes or diminishes. Thus, I speak of my Lord. There is no lord besides  Allah. He is the Great and of un-matching greatness. He is the Most Majestic and of  unmatched Majesty. He is the Most Glorious and of unmatched Glory. He is far above what  the unjust think of Him to be.\"",

O Dhi‘lab, my Lord is subtle in   subtleties but can not be described by means of subtle matters. My Lord is great but can not be described by means of greatness. His greatness surpasses all greatness but he can not be  described by means of such greatness. He is Glorious in His Glory but He can not be  described in terms of thickness. He is before everything and it can not be said that something  was before Him. He will be after all things but it can not be said that there is something after  Him. He willed the existence of things but not by means of first thinking about it. He  comprehends things but not with a great deal of efforts. Things are not mixed with Him and  nor is He indifferent about them. He is clearly manifest but not with contacts and changes. He  shines but not in the form of being found out with eye sight. He is far but not in the form of  distance. He is near but not in the form of nearness. He is very fine but not in the form of  physical fineness. He exists but not after nothingness. He acts but not because of being  forced. He measures things but not by means of movement. He wills but not by means of  thinking. He hears but not with tools. He sees but not with instruments. He is not contained in  place and held up in times. Attributes do not limit Him and slumber does not seize Him. His  Being was before the time and His existence was before nothingness. He was before eternity.  His giving the sense awareness prove that He does not have the tools for sensing. His giving  substance to the substances is proof that Himself is not a substance. The existence of a  contrary to everything is proof that there is nothing contrary to Him. His giving nearness to  things is proof that there is nothing similar to Him. He has made the light contrary to the  darkness, the wetness to the dryness, the harshness to the softness, the coldness to the heat.  He combines their transgressing and separates their closeness. The separation among things is  evidence of the existence of the One Who causes separation in them and their combinations is  evidence of the existence of the One Who combines them. It is jus as Allah has said, \"We  have created everything in pairs so that perhaps you may take heed (51:49).\" He has made a  distinction between the before and after to show that there is no before and after for Him. The  instincts show that the One who created the instincts Himself has no instinct. The time is  evidence that there is no timing for the One Who made the time. Things are hidden from each  other are evidence that nothing hides them from their Creator. He was the Lord when there  was nothing to enjoy His Lordship. He was to be worshipped when there was no worshipper.  He had the knowledge when there was nothing to know. He was hearing when there was  nothing to hear.\"",

The Imam said ‘It is strange that a group of people ascribe to Amirul Mu’minin certain things  that he had never said.

The fact that His creatures are similar is evidence that there is nothing similar to  Him. His signs are evidence of His great power. His Own-self prohibits acceptance of  descriptions and so are His being seen with the eyes and His being comprehended in the  imaginations. There is no time limit for His being in existence and there is no final destination  for Him. Awareness can not contain Him and coverings can not cover Him. The curtain  between Him and His creatures is His creating them. It is because of being impossible for  Him what is possible in the essence of the creatures and because of what may be possible in  their case is impossible in His case. It is also because of the difference between the Creator  and the created, the limited and the unlimited and the Lord and the worshippers. He is One  without being a unit of a particular kind. He is the Creator but not terms of motion. He is  seeing but not by means of tools. He is hearing but not with distinguishing instruments. He  observes but not by means of touching. He is hidden but not with covering. He is clearly  manifest but not with lapse due to distance. His eternity is beyond the reach of thinking and a  stop for the aims of the intelligence. His reality has worn out the ability of sight and His Own- self has uprooted the (spreading) vines of imaginations.

A perfect knowledge  about Him is to know that He is One. A perfect belief in His Oneness is to negate all  attributes from Him. Every attribute is evidence that it is different from what it is attributed  to. That everything to which an attribute is ascribed is evidence that it is something other than  the attribute. Both the attribute and to whatever it is attributed are evidence that there are two  things which invalidate His being eternal. Whoever attributes a quality to Allah he has  considered Him limited. Whoever considers Him limited he has enumerated Him and  whoever enumerates Him he has considered His eternity invalid. Whoever says how is He, he  has he has considered Him describable.

Abu Ishaq has  said that he asked al-Harith if he has recorded that sermon.\" Al-Harith said, \"I have recorded  the sermon in writing.\" He then dictated it to us from his book. \"All praise is due to Allah  Who does not die Whose wonders do not end. It is because everyday He has a task in the  form of the invention of something that did not exist. It is He Who has no children so that He  would share others in Majesty and He is not the child of others so that He would be inherited  and Himself banish. The imaginations can not comprehend Him to figure Him out in some  form of similitude. The eyes have not perceived Him so that after changing position He would  also change. It is He for whose beginning there is no end nor there is a final destination for  His being the last. It is He before Whom there is no time and is not preceded by any duration.  He does not become defective by reduction or addition. He does not become attributed with  direction or of what is He made of or with place. It is He Who knows all the hidden matters  and has surpassed all intelligence what is evident in His creatures of plans and maintenance. It  is He about Whom the prophets were asked and they did not speak of Him in terms of limits  and parts. They spoke of His acts and showed people His signs. The intelligence of thinkers  can not deny Him because the One who has created the heavens and earth and all that is in  them and between them and is their Creator no one is able to stand up to His power. It is He,  Who is different from the creatures and there is nothing similar to Him. It is He, Who has  created the creatures for His worship and has given them the ability to obey Him. With the  capabilities that He has placed in them and has removed all their excuses He has placing His  authority among them so that after knowing the authority would perish whoever would like to  perish and after knowing the authority receive salvation whoever would like to receive  salvation. Benevolent is Allah to begin and to repeat. Then, Allah, to Whom all praise is due,  introduced praise for His Own-self. He has finished the affairs of the world and the coming of  the next life with praise for His Own-self saying, \"He has judged among them with the truth\"  and All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds.\"All praise is due to Allah, Who has dressed up with greatness but with out a body, Who has put on the gown of Majesty and Glory which has no similarity. It is He, Who has control over  the Throne without losing such authority. He is far Exalted above the creatures but without   being far from them or being in touch with them. He has no limit that would end to a limit nor there is anything similar to Him to help know Him better. All things are humble before His  power and might. All things, although great, are small before Him. All things respect His  Greatness, obey His authority and Majesty. Glimpses of eyes are weak and exhausted in  trying to comprehend Him. The imaginations of the creatures fall far short off describing  Him. He is the first before all things and there was is no one before Him. He is the last after  all things and there is no after for Him. He has control over all things with might. He observes  all places without moving thereto. No touching touches Him and no sense senses Him. He is  the Lord in the heavens and the Lord on earth. He is All-wise and All-knowing. He has given  firm shape and form to His creatures the way He willed but not with following previous  examples and without experiencing any fatigue in the creation of the things that He has  created. He began what He wanted to begin and invented what He wanted to invent and the  way He willed of the two great and heavy creatures, the man and Jinn so that they would  know Him through such evidence His Lordship and established in them His obedience.\"We thank Him with all of His praise for all of His bounties. We ask Him for His guidance to give us wisdom in our affairs. We seek His refuge from the evil of our sinful deeds and ask  Him to forgive our sins that we may have committed before. We testify that there is no god  but Allah and that Muhammad (s.a.) is His servant and messengers. He sent him with truth as  a prophet, as a sign of His existence and a guide to Him. (We) found guidance through him  from straying and are saved through him from ignorance. Whoever obeys Allah and His  messenger has indeed gained a great success and has earned a great reward. Whoever  disobeys Allah and His messengers has indeed suffered a clear loss and is subjected to a  painful punishment. Make sure to succeed in obedience and listening, sincerity, good advice  and proper support. Be helpful to yourselves to keep on the straight path and shun the detested  matters. Deal among yourselves with truth and cooperate thereby with me. Hold back the  unjust and feeble minded hands. Make others do good and prevent them from committing  unlawful deeds.

He has designed their happiness to be His Own happiness and their anger as  His-Own anger. It is because He has assigned them to guide people to Him and serve as proof  of His existence. For this reason such conditions belong to them. This does not reach Allah  the way it reaches people. The meaning is what just mentioned. He has also said, \"Whoever  would humiliate My friends such people have declared war against Me with challenge.\" He  has also said, \"One who obeys the Messenger has certainly obeyed God. . . .\" (4:80). \"Those  who pledge obedience to you are, in fact, pledging obedience to God. The hands of God are  above their hands. . . .\" (48:10). All of these and other similar ones mean what I just said. The  same is the case with anger and happiness and other such matters. Had it been possible for  frustration and anger to reach Allah one could have said that one-day Allah will banish  altogether. It is because if anger and frustration would reach Him changes also would take  place in Him and, thus, He will not remain safe from banishment. As a result, there would  exist no distinction between the created and the Creator, between the Almighty and those  subject to such might and power. No distinction would remain between the created and the  Creator. Allah is far above such things, and is the Most High and Most Great. He is the  Creator of all things not because he needed them. If it would be without the need then it  would be impossible to limit Him with limits and conditions. Note this if Allah would will it  to be so.\"",

He let happen  what He had decreed and decreed what he had measured and measured what He had willed.  From His knowledge was His wish. From His wish was His will and from His will was His  measuring. From His measuring was His decree and from His decree was His letting it to  happen. Knowledge is before the wish. The wish is the second and the will is the third.  Measuring happens up on the decree to let it happen. For Allah, the Most Holy, the Most  High, there is al-Bada’ in whatever He knows when He wants and in the will to measure  things. When the decree is issued to let it happen then there is no al-Bada’. Thus, the  knowledge of the object of knowledge is before it comes into existence. The wish for the  object of wish is before its substance. The will in what iis willed iis before it is established.  The measuring of these objects of knowledge is before their details and before their reaching  the stage of being manifested in their substance and time. The decree to let it happen is  decisive in the acts with body and what is perceived with the senses of the colored having  smells and weight and measurement and things walking, crawling and creeping on earth of  man, Jinn, birds, beasts and others that are comprehended with the senses. Al-Bada’ happens with Allah in the matters that have no substance. When substance and meaning would appear then there is no al-Bada’. Allah does whatever He wants. With  knowledge He has the knowledge of the things before their coming into existence. With the  wish He has the knowledge their qualities and their limits. He invented them before they  became manifest. With the will He distinguished them in their colors and qualities. With  measurement He measured their sustenance and and made their beginning and end.

He has not given (the power to people) in the absolute sense. He  has not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them without a purpose.

You will not know until  you acknowledge. You will not acknowledge until you safeguard the four doors and the first  of these doors will not do any good without the last. The people of the three strayed far away   from the (right) path. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, accepts only the righteous deeds. Allah does not accept with one’s fulfilling the conditions of the covenant. Those who remain  faithful to Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, about His condition and follow what is  prescribed in the covenant he will receive blessings from Him and He will keep His promise.  Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has informed the people of the path of guidance and has  sanctioned for them the laws of Shari‘a as beacons. He has informed them how to follow the  laws. He has said, \"I am All-forgiving to the righteously striving believers who repent and  follow the right guidance.\" (20:82) \"Allah (God) only accepts the offerings of the pious  ones.\" (5:27)Those who are pious before Allah about His commandments they meet Allah as believers in in whatever Prophet has brought to them from Allah. It is unfortunate that people died before  finding guidance. They thought that they were believers but they became polytheist without  realizing it.Those who enter the house through the door they are rightly guided. Those who go other ways they are on the path to destruction. Allah has connected the obedience to the people of Divine  authority with the obedience to His Messenger and the obedience to His messenger with  obedience to His Own-self. Those who would disregard obedience to the people of Divine  authority they have not obeyed Allah and His Messenger. This obedience is the  acknowledgment of what Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has sent. (That you) be well  dressed with means of beauty near every mosque; that you should enter the doors of the  houses that Allah has given permission to be uplifted wherein His names be mentioned. Allah  has certainly informed you that there are certain man whose attentions and mind do not  deviate from speaking about Allah, prayer and paying charity because of business and trade  attractions. They only fear the Day in which the hearts and eyes turn upside down.Allah has appointed the messengers for commands. He then chose them to acknowledge in His Warning and said, \"No nation who lived before was left without a Warner . . .\" (35:25)  Stray those who are ignorant and find the right guidance those who think and understand.  Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has said, \"It is their hearts in the center which are blind,  not their ears.\" (22:46) How can one does not see find guidance and how would one  understand without thinking? Follow the Messenger of Allah and his Ahlul Bayt (family) and  acknowledge what Allah has sent and follow the traces of guidance. They (Ahlul Bayt) are  the signs of trust and piety. Know that if a person would deny Jesus, the son of Mary (a.s.)  and acknowledge all the other prophets such person will not be considered a believer. Follow  the path by the help of the lighthouses and follow the signs from behind the barriers. Try to  perfect the matters of your religion and have faith in Allah, your Lord.\"",

She would  wonder around during the day and at nightfall she would see a different flock of sheep with a  shepherd and she would glad and affectionately join it thinking it to be like her own flock.  She would pass the night in their barn but in the morning when the shepherd let the flock out  she could not recognize her flock and shepherd and begin to wonder in search for her own  flock and shepherd and saw a flock and a shepherd. She then would rush to the flock with  great interest but the shepherd shouted, ‘Go to your own flock and shepherd because you are  lost and wondering.’ She then would run back and forth lost and wondering without a  shepherd to show her the grazing areas and the barn.

Such people are lost and straying. If such  people would in such a condition their death would be like that of an unbeliever and  hypocrite. O Muhammad, take notice that the unjust Imams and their followers are far away  from the religion of Allah. They have lost the right path and have mislead the others.

We are the Heights without whose  knowing there is no other way to know Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High. We are the Heights that Allah on the Day of Judgment will make known to everyone on the bridge. No   one will enter paradise without knowing us and our knowing them. No one will enter hell except those would not know us and we will ignore them.If Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, would want to let people know Him He may do so but He has made us the door to knowing Him, the bridge, the path and the aspect to Him.  Whoever would deviate from our authority and guardianship or would consider others more  excellent than us such people will down off the bridge. People are the same in following  guidance.

In fact, it is the creature who are recognized through Allah.’\" The  Imam (a.s.) said you have is very true.\" I then said, \"One who knows that he has a creator he  must also know that his creator becomes with certain things and displeased with certain other  things. That the only way to know what is pleases the creator and what displeases Him is  through divine revelation or a messengers. One who does not receive Divine revelation must  find the messenger and when one would find the messengers and upon finding the messenger  one would learn that they are the Divine authorities and obedience to them is obligatory. I say  it to people, \"Do you not acknowledge that obedience to the holy Prophet possessed Divine  authority from Allah over His creatures?\" They say, \"Yes, it is true.\" I then say to them,  \"When the holy Prophet left this world who possessed Divine authority over the people?\" The  say, \"The holy Quran.\" I then looked in the holy Quran and I found out that all kinds of  people consider this holy as the basis for their beliefs. The group called al-Murji’a consider it  as the basis for whatever it believes. Those who believe in predestination also consider this   holy Book as the basis for whatever they believe in. Even the atheists who do not even believe in it at all refer to this holy book to defeat the others. This proves that the holy Quran  can not be considered a Divine authority without a guardian whose words about the Quran  would be the true ones. I then ask them, \"Who is the guardian of the Quran?\" They reply, \"Ibn  Mas‘ud knew the Quran. ‘Umar knew the Quran. Hudhayfa knew the Quran.\" I then ask  them, \"Did these people know all of the Quran?\" They say, \"No, they did not know all of the  Quran.\" I do not find anyone who would say that he knows all of the Quran. The only one  who says that he knows all of the Quran is Ali, may Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him.  If any question would arise in these people, that one would say that he did not know. The  other one would say that he did not know and so on except Ali that would say that he did  know. That gives enough proof to say that Ali was the guardian of the Quran. Obedience to  Ali was obligatory by the command of Allah and he possessed Divine authority over the people after the holy Prophet (s.a.). Whatever Ali (a.s.) said about the holy Quran is true.\" The Imam said, \"May Allah’s blessings  be with you.\" I then said, \"Imam Ali (a.s.) did not leave this world without introducing the  person who possessed Divine authority over the people after him just as the holy Prophet (s. a.) had done.

The shining star stands for the Holy lady Fatima (a.s.) who shines among the ladies of the world. The blessed olive tree stands for  Prophet Abraham.

It is darkness upon darkness whereby  even if one stretches out his hands he can not see them. One can have no light unless God gives him light.

"Content": "Abu Muhammad al-Qasim ibn al-'Ala', may Allah grant him blessings, in a marfu‘ manner (rafa'abu), has narrated from ‘Ad al-'Aziz ibn Muslim the following.\"We had been with al-Rida (a.s.) at Marw. During an assembly in the central mosque on Friday, we attended the gathering. It was when we had just arrived (in Marw). People spoke  and discussed about the issue of Imamat (Leadership with Divine Authority). All the differing  opinions among people in this matter came up. I then went to see my leader (a.s.) and  informed him of the people’s controversies over the issue (leadership).The Imam (a.s.) smiled and then said the following. \"O 'Abd al-'Aziz, people are ignorant and their opinions have mislead and deceived them. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, did not  cause His Holy Prophet to leave this world before completing for him the religion. Allah sent  him the Holy Quran in which all things are clearly explained. Allah has explained in the Holy  Quran what is lawful and what is unlawful. He has explained totally the limits and the rules  for all issues that people may face in the affairs of life. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High,  has said, \"We have left nothing without a mention of it in the Book. . . .\" (6:38)During the last visit of the Holy Prophet to Makka for pilgrimage towards the end of his life the following verse of the Holy Qauran was sent to him. \"On this day I have perfected your  religion, completed My favors to you, and have chosen Islam as your religion. . . .\" (5:3) The  issue of Imamat (leadership) is part of the completion of religion. The Holy Prophet (s.a.) did  not leave this world before explaining to his followers the principles of their religion and  show them the path clearly, and he left them on a point of a path that faced the direction of the  truth. He raised Ali (a.s.) among them as a flag and Imam (a leader). He did not leave  anything that his followers needed without full explanation. Those who think that Allah, the  Most Holy, the Most High, has not completed His religion, they rejected the book of Allah  and those who reject the book of Allah they have become expressed unbelievers in it.\"Do they realize the value and the status of the Imamat (leadership) of the ’Umma (the nation) to justify their selection? Imamat (leadership) in fact, is far sublime in values, greatest in  position, highest in status, the most exclusive issue in all aspects, the most profound and deep  for the intellect of the people to reach and grasp it in their opinions, or to appoint an Imam   through their selection. TImamat (leadership) is that particular distinction which Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has distinguished Ibrahim, the very close friend (al-Khalil), after Prophethood. This close  friendship is the third stage (in the progression of spiritual degrees). It is a virtue with which,  He honored him and established his fame. He then said, \"Behold! I have made you an Imam  for the people\". Abraham, the close friend, then out of delight pleaded \"Please let it be in my  offspring also.\" Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, said, \"My covenant does not go to the  unjust ones.\" (2:124) Thus, this verse has declared the leadership (Imamat) of all the unjust ones as unlawful till the Day of Judgment and it has established it for those clean and free of evil and injustice. Allah,  the Most Holy, the Most High, bestowed him more honors in establishing Imamat  (leadership) in purified and clean persons of his offspring. \"We granted him Isaac and Jacob  as a gift and helped both of them to become righteous people (21:72). We appointed them as  leaders to guide the people through Our command and sent them revelation to strive for good  deeds, worship their Lord, and pay religious tax. Both of them were Our worshipping  servants.\" (21:73)\"So the Imamat (leadership) remained in his offspring inheriting it from each other, generation after generation, until Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, made Prophet  Muhammad (s.a.) to inherit it. And He, Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, said, \"The  nearest people to Abraham, among mankind, are those who followed him, and this Prophet  (Muhammad) and the true believers. God is the Guardian of the true believers.\" (3:68)So the Imamat belonged to him particularly, and he (s.a.), then, entrusted Imam Ali ((a.s.) with it by the command of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, as He had made it  obligatory. It then came to be in his (Ali's) purified and clean of sins offspring, to whom  Allah has given knowledge and faith, as in the words of He Who is Most High. \"Those who  have received knowledge and have faith will say, \"By the decree of God, you have remained  for the exact period which was mentioned in the Book of God about the Day of Resurrection.  This is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not know.\" (30:56) Imamat (leadership) will remain in the sons of Imam Ali (a.s.) exclusively, till the Day of Judgment and there will no prophet after Muhammad (s.a.). Wherefrom then have these  ignorant people received the right to select Imams?\" Imamat (leadership) is, certainly, the position of the prophets, and the inheritance of the successors. Imamat (leadership) indeed, is the representation (khilafa) of Allah and the deputy  of the Messenger (s.a.), and the office of Amir al-mu'minin (a.s.) and the inheritance of Imam  al-Hasan and al-Husayn (a.s.)   \"Imamat (leadership) is, in fact, the reins of the religion, the social system of the Muslims. It is best for the world, and honor for the believers. Imamat (Islamic leadership) is Islam's  maturing root, and its towering branch. Through the Imam (a.s.) prayers are complete, Zakat,  (charity) is paid, fasting, is maintained, Hajj is performed and Jihad, proper defense is  exercised, the wealth of the nation (fay') and charity (sadaqat) are increased, the laws are  enforced and the frontiers are protected and defended.\"The Imam declares as lawful what Allah has done so and prohibits what Allah has prohibited. He enforces the criminal laws of Allah, defends the religion of Allah and he  provides guidance with wisdom, good advice and with the topmost strong evidence.\"The Imam is like the risen sun that beautifies the world with its light and is in the horizon above the harm of hands and eyes. The Imam is as the bright moon, the shining lamp, the  brilliant light, and the guiding star in the depth of darkness, in the middle of the towns, in the  wilderness and the high seas. The Imam is as crystal-clear water to thirst, an indicator of true  guidance and the protector against destruction. The Imam is as fire of a lighthouse that  provides warmth and guidance for those who seek heat protection against fatalities. Whoever  would depart him would perish.\"The Imam (in terms of blessings) is as the rain-bearing cloud, the drenching rainfall, the shining sun, the shadow providing sky, the open fields, the gushing forth spring, as a pond  and a garden. The Imam is as a comforting friend, a very kind father, a real brother, a tender- hearted mother of a small child, a refuge for people in disastrous conditions. The Imam is  Allah's trustee over His creatures, His authority over His servants, His representative in His  lands, the preacher of His cause and the defender of His sanctuary.\"The Imam is clean of sins, free of faults, possesses special knowledge and is distinguished in forbearance. The Imam maintains law and order in religion. He is the might of the Muslims to  enrages the hypocrites, and futile to unbelievers. The Imam is the peerless person of his time,  no-one can reach even near his rank in virtue and no scholar is comparable to him. No one  can become A number of our people has narrated from alternative for him, nor is there anyone  similar to him or just like him. His is exclusive in all virtues of which none is acquired or is  sought after, in fact, his virtues are all from bestowed up on him by the source of all virtue,  the Generous One.Who is he that can know all about the Imam, or can select him? To affirm the ability of selection is very far from the truth. Intellects have become confused, understanding has lost  the meaning, awareness is frustrated, eyes have become dull and tired, the great ones have  become humble, the sagacious ones have become bewildered and people of forbearance have  lost patience. The orators have become speechless, the intelligent ones have become ignorant  and the poets have become exhausted. The man-of-letter have become helpless, people of  eloquence have turned wordless to speak of any of the aspects of his status or a virtue of his   virtues and instead have confessed their helplessness in the matter. How can one speak of him in full, or describe him in the real sense or understand anything of his affairs or find an  alternative for him sufficient for what he sufficed. There is no such thing and no where such  is found. He is like a star away from the reach of those who try to reach, or those who try to  describe. Where does the idea of selecting him would then stand in such case? How can then  reasons and intellects reach him and where can one find a person like the Imam?\"Would they think that such a person can be found outside the family of the Holy Prophet (s.a.)? Their souls, I swear by Allah, have told them a lie. Falsehood has induced in them evil  hopes. Be on your guard against A number of our people has narrated from uphill and  crushing battle in which they would slip back to their first foothold. They intend to raise the  Imam by their confused, fruitless and faulty intellects and their misleading opinions. It would  do to nothing god except taking them away from the truth. (May Allah be their adversary.  Where are they headed.) (Holy Quran 9:30) They have aimed at a difficult task and have  spoken something meaningless. They have strayed far away from the truth and have faced  huge confusions. They have knowingly ignored the Imam (a.s.). It is Satan who, has made  their deeds to seem attractive to them and has blocked them from reaching the path (of  guidance) when they know it fully. They have turned from the choice that Allah and His Messenger and his family of to accept their own choice. The Holy Quran calls up on them, \"Your Lord creates and chooses (to grant  mercy) to whomever He wants. (In matters of guidance) they (unbelievers) do not have the  choice to choose whatever they want. God is too exalted to be considered equal to anything  else.\" (28:68) It also says, \"The believing men and women must not feel free to do something  in their affairs other than that which has been already decided for them by God and His  Messenger. One who disobeys God and His Messenger is in plain error. (33:36)It further says, \"What is the matter with you? How could you judge this to be so? (68:36). Do you have a book from which you study (68:37) that tells you to do whatever you want?  (68:38). Do you have a covenant with Us which allows you to do whatever you want until the  Day of Judgment? (68:39). (Muhammad), ask which of them can guarantee that on the Day of Judgment (68:40). they will receive the same thing that the Muslims will? Do they have any witness to such an  agreement? Let them bring out such witness, if they are truthful.\"(68:41).Again the Holy Quran says, \"Is it that they do not think about the Quran or are their hearts sealed?\" (47:24) Or as it says, \". . . their hearts were sealed and they were left with no  understanding.\" (9:87) or like, \"Do not be like those who said that they have heard (the  Messenger's commands) but do not pay any attention to them (8:21). The most wicked beasts  in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb who have no understanding (8:22). Had they  possessed any virtue, God would certainly have made them hear. Even if God were to make   them hear, they would still turn away from (the words of God).\" (8:23) or like, \"you said that you had listened but you disobeyed.. . .\" (2:93) It is the grace from Allah and He gives to  whoever He wills. Allah is possesses great generosity.How would they have the right to choose the Imam (a.s.)? The Imam (a.s.) is a scholar that is not ignorant of any thing, a shepherd who does not become, the mine of holiness purity, of  worship and restraint from sins and Knowledge and worship. He (enjoys) the blessings of the  exclusive prayers of the Messenger of Allah and of being of the progeny of the Holy Lady, al- Batul. There is not question about their genealogical purity. He is of the house of Quraysh and  the top most in clan of Hashim and of the family of the Messenger of Allah, enjoying the  happiness of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, is the honor of all nobility. He is of the  offspring of ‘Abd al-Manaf. He possesses (a body of) increasing knowledge. He is perfect in  forbearance, the only one to qualify for the position of Imamat (leadership). He has full  knowledge of the politics, whose obedience is obligatory by the command of Allah. He is  appointed for Imamat by the command of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High to give good  advice to the servants of Allah and to protect the religion of Allah.Allah grants success and support to the prophets and the Imams (a.s.) through His treasured knowledge and command in a way that is granted to no one else. Thus, their knowledge is  above the knowledge of the people of their times as mentioned in the following words of  Allah. \"Is the one who guides to the Truth a proper guide or one who himself cannot find  guidance unless he is guided (by others)? What is wrong with you that you judge (so  unjustly)?\" (10:35) and in, \"Whoever is given wisdom, certainly, has received much  good. . . .\"(2:269). Or as about Talut in the following words, \"God has chosen him as your  ruler and has given him physical power and knowledge. God grants His authority to anyone  whom He wants. God is Provident and All-knowing. (2:247) or as He has said about His  Prophet (a.s.),\"God has revealed the Book to you, has given you wisdom, and has taught you what you did not know. Certainly God's favor to you has been great.\" (4:113) He also said about the Imams  from the family of the Holy Prophet (s.a.) \"Are they jealous of the favors that God has done to  some people? We have given to the family of Abraham the Book, Wisdom, and a great  Kingdom (4:54). Some have believed, others have disbelieved and tried to prevent people  from believing. For these people, only the intense fire of hell is a sufficient  punishment.\" (4:55)  When Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, chooses a person for the affairs of His servants, He opens his heart for the task, places in it the fountains of wisdom and inspires him with  knowledge. He then never becomes tired of answering questions and never becomes confused  to miss the right answer. He is infaliable, Divinely supported, successful and gaurded. He is   immune from sins and shortcomings and faults. Allah has granted him this exclusively so that he would serve as the Divine authority over His servant, as a witness over them and this is  grace of Allah that He grant to whoever He wills and Allah’s grace is the greatest.Can one among the people have such things so they would choose him as the Imam or can their selected person have such distinctions to be preferred over the others?They, swearing to the house of Allah, have transgressed against the truth and have thrown the book of Allah behind their backs as if they do not know. In the book of Allah there is  guidance and cure but they have ignored it and have followed their own desires. For this  reason Allah has criticised, expressed anger and condemmned them in His words as follows.  \"Who strays more than one who follows his desires without guidance from God? God does  not guide the unjust people.\" (28:50) .\"The fate of the unbelievers will be to stumble and their deeds will have no virtuous results;\" (47:8)\"This act greatly angers God and the believers. Thus does God seal the hearts of every arrogant oppressor.\" (40:35). May Allah grant blessings up on Prophet Muhammad and his family and may He grant them peace, a great deal of peace.\"",

"Content": "Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn 'Isa from al-Hasan ibn Mahbub from Ishaq ibn Ghalib from abu 'Abdallah (a.s.) who has described the condition of  the Imams (a.s.) and their attributes in one of his sermons.\"Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has explained His religion through the Imams of (true) guidance from the family of our Prophet (s.a.) the Ahlul Bayt (a.s.), and has clear through  them the path of His system and plan. He has opened through them the inside of the springs of  His knowledge. Whoever of the followers of Muhammad (s.a.) has recognized his obligation  towards the rights of his Imam he has realized the taste of the sweetness of his faith and the  superior beauty of his Islam. It is because Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has appointed  the Imam the torchbearer for His creatures and authority over those who receive His blessings  of His world. He has crowned him with dignity and has encompassed him in the Light of His  Omnipotence. He extends a means to the heavens. The blessings do not discontinue from him.  Nothing from what is with Allah is achieved except through its right means. Allah does not  accept the good deeds of His servants without one’s recognition of the Imam (a.s.). The Imam  (a.s.) knows how to sort out the dark confusing matters and whatever obscures the Sunnah  (tradition of the Holy Prophet (s.a.) and the confounding matters in mischievous conditions.   Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has always been choosing the Imams from the descendants of al-Husayn (a.s.) one after the other Imam. He would select and choose them  for the leadership of His creatures delightfully and well satisfied with them. Whenever one  Imam would leave this world He would appoint for His creatures his successor as a clear  beacon and a shining guide, a guarding leader, a knowledgeable Divine authority. The Imams  from Allah guide people with the truth and with the truth they judge. They are Allah’s  authority calling people to Him and as shepherds of His creatures. With their guidance people  follow the religion and from them the land receive light. Through their holiness the bounties  increase. Allah has made them life for the people and the torches in the darkness, the keys to  communication and the strongholds for Islam. Thus, has the measures of Allah continued in  them towards His final decision.\"The Imam is the outstanding amicable person, the most trusted guide and the guardian who can make hopes come true. Allah has chosen him with such distinctions. He choose him as  such in the realm when all things were in the form of particles in the instance that He made  him made him a particle and in the realm in which all things were designed as He had  designed him (well-protected) as a shadow??, before He made the organisms, on the right side  of His throne, gifted with wisdom in the unseen knowledge with Him. He chose him in His  knowledge and granted him outstanding nobility for his purity. He is a heir of Adam, the best  one among the descendents, the chosen one of the family of Abraham, a descendent of Ismael  and of the most preferred ones in the family of Prophet Muhammad (s.a.). He has always been  looked after by the watchful eyes of Allah Who would provide him security and guard him  with His shield, well protected against the evil nets of Satan and his armies. He is well  defended against the approaching dark nights and the false accusations of the evil doers. All  wickedness is kept away from him and he kept safe against all forms of defects and flaws. He  is veiled against all the scourge and infallible in the case of sins. He is kept safe and sound  against all indecencies. He is well known for his forbearance and virtuousness in the early  days of his life and great knowledge, chastity and excellence are ascribed to him towards the  end of his life. The task of Imamt (leadership) of his father rests with him while in the lifetime  of his father he remained silent. When the time of the Imamat (leadership) of his father ends it is the time when the measures of Allah ends up with him to His wish, the will from Allah brings him to His love, thus, the  end of the Imamat of his father comes and he passes away. The authority from Allah shifts to  him after his father. He then is made in charge of His religion and the Divine authority over  His servants, the guardian over His lands, supported with His spirit and is given of His  knowledge. He raises him as a beacon for His creatures, makes him to have His authority over  the people of his world and as the light for the people of His religion and a guardian for His  servants. Allah will agree to have him as Imam of the people, entrust him with His secret,  makes him a safe-keeper of His knowledge, and makes him to hide His wisdom in him. He  protects him for His religion calls up on him to serve His great task, revives through him the  phases of His system (of religion) and the obligations in His laws.   The Imam then enforces justice, when the people of ignorance are confused and the disputing and quarrelling people are frustrated, with shining light, the beneficial cure and radiant truth.  He would do so with clear explanations of all aspects and just in the manner and practice his  truthful father and forefathers would do before him. No one would ignore the rights of such  scholar except the wicked ones. No one would struggle against him except those who have  strayed away from the right path. No one would keep away from him except those who keep a  bold face against Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High.",

For  these people, only the intense fire of hell is a sufficient punishment (4:55). We will make  those who reject Our revelations suffer in hell fire.

"Content": "A number of our people has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Isa from Ali ibn al-Hakam from Mu’awiya ibn Wahab from Sa‘id al-Samman who has said the following. \"I was  in the presence of abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) when two people from the Zaydia sect came to him.  They asked, \"Is there with you an Imam obedience to whom is obligatory?\" The narrator has  said that the Imams (a.s.) said, \"No, there no one as such.\" They then said, \"Reliable people  have informed us about you that you issue fatwas and that you affirm and speak of it. We can  point out what their names are. They are very pious alert people. They are such that can not  be rejected. The Imams (a.s.) became angry and said, \"I have not ordered them to say so.\"  When the two men notice anger from the face of The Imams (a.s.) they left.\"The Imams (a.s.) then asked me, \"Do you know these two?\" I said, \"Yes, I know them. They are from our Suq (shopping center). They belong to the Zaydia sect and they think that the  sword of the Holy Prophet (s.a.) is with ‘Abdallah ibn al-Hassan.\" The Imams (a.s.) said,  \"They have lied, may Allah condemn them. I swear by Allah, ‘Abdallah ibn al-Hassan has not  seen it with his own eyes, not even of his eyes has seen it. Even his father had seen it except if  he might have seen it with Imam Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.). If they are truthful let them say  what kind of mark does its hilt have and what is the mark on its blade?With me is the sword of the Messenger of Allah, with me is the flag of the Messenger, his coat of arms, his Lamam (pennon) and his helmet. If they are truthful let them say what kind  of mark does the coat of arms of the Messenger of Allah has? With me is the flag of the  Messenger of Allah, the victorious. With me is the Staff of Moses. With me is the ring of  Solomon son of David. With me is tray on Moses used to offer offerings. With me is the  name that whenever the Messenger of Allah would place it between the Muslims and pagans  no arrow from the pagans would reach the Muslims. With me is the similar object that angels  brought.\" Perhaps The Imams (a.s.) has hinted to the following verse. ‘Their Prophet further  told them, \"As the evidence of his authority, he will bring to you the Ark which will be a  comfort to you from your Lord and a legacy of the household of Moses and Aaron. It will be  carried by the angels. This is the evidence for you if you have faith.’ (2:248) The case of the Arms with us is like the case of the Ark in the Israelites. Whichever family   would have had the Ark at their door-front that family would receive prophet-hood. To whoever of us the Arms are transferred he receives Imamat (leadership with Divine  authority). My father wore the coats of arms of the Messenger of Allah. It would reach the  earth and leave marks. I wore it also and it reached the earth and sometimes it would not.  When the one from us who, will rise to establish the authority of Allah on earth, will come it  will fit him perfectly, if Allah would so will.\"",

He caused discontinuation in the Tawaf of the Imam (a.s.) and took him (a.s.) to a house  adjacent to al-Safa. He sent for me also and then we were there three of us. He said,  \"Welcome, the child of the Messenger of Allah. He then placed his hand over my head and  said, ‘May Allah place blessings in you, the trustworthy one before Allah after his ancestors.  O abu Ja‘far (a.s.), if you like you may tell me, and if you like I can tell you. If you like you  may ask me and if you want I will ask you. If you would like affirm what I will say and if you  would want I will affirm what you will say. The Imam (a.s.) said, \"I like all of it.\" He then  said, \"You must never let your tongue answer me with something that is otherwise in your  conscious.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Such would do one in whose heart there would exist two  kinds of knowledge, one opposing the other. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, disdains to  have a knowledge that is not harmonious.\" He then said, \"This is my question. You just  explained one part of it.\"Tell me about this knowledge that is so harmonious and without difference. Who has   (knows) it?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"The whole of knowledge is before Allah, Majestic is Whose Name. The knowledge that people need is with the executor of the will of (prophets).  The narrator has said that he then removed the covering from his face, set down straight, his  face looked more cheerful and he said, \"This is what I wanted and for this I have come. You  think that the knowledge that is free of differences is with the executors of the wills of the  prophets. How do they know it?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Just as the Messenger of Allah knew  it except that they do not see what the Messenger of Allah would see. It is because that he was  a prophet and they are the Muhaddithun, spokesmen of the Divine message. The Messenger  of Allah, when as a delegate before Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, would hear  whatever would have been communicated to him as (Wahy) but they do not hear such  communications.\" He then said, \"You have spoken the truth, O child of the Messenger of  Allah. I now ask you a more difficult question. Tell me, why does this knowledge not appear  as was it with the Messenger of Allah?\" The narrator has said that my father then smiled and  said, \"Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, disdains to let those people have information  about His knowledge whom He has not yet tested with faith. (Such test) was carried out on  the Messenger of Allah in the form of his enduring the suffering caused to him from his  people so much so that he would struggle against them with His permission. Many times he  would withhold matters that would disappoint his people until he was commanded sternly to  convey to them the commandments that he had received and disregard the pagans. \"Preach  what you have been commanded to and stay away from the pagans.\" (15:94)\"I swear by Allah, had he conveyed the commandments he would have been perfectly safe. He, in fact, considered the obedience and feared differences. For this reason he would  withhold. I would love that you would keep your eye upon the advent of al-Mahdi (the guide)  of this nation. (A time) when the angels with the sword of the family of David would make  the dead spirits of the unbelievers between the heavens and the earth test the results of their  evil deeds and force the spirits of the living ones like them to join the unbelievers.\"He then drew a sword and said, \"Here it is. This is one of them.\" The narrator has said, \"Then my father said, \"Yes, that is very true, I swear by the One Who chose Muhammad from  among the mankind.\" The narrator has said that then the man drew the cover over his face and  said, \"I am Ilyas. I did not ask you those questions about that because I did not know them. I  only loved that this conversation and narration strengthen your followers. I will tell you about  a sign and evidence that you know if they (your followers) would debate others, your friends  will win. The narrator has said that my father then said to him, \"If you would like I can tell  you about it (the sign and evidence).\" He then said, \"I would wish to hear it from you.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"If our followers would say to those who differ from us, \"Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High says to His Messenger, \"We revealed the Quran on the Night of  Destiny ((97:1). Would that you knew what the Night of Destiny is! (97:2).(Worship) on the Night of Destiny is better than (worship) for a thousand months (97:3). On this Night, the angels and the spirit descend by the permission of their Lord with His decree   (to determine everyone's destiny) (97:4).This Night is all peace until the break of dawn\" (97:5).\"Did the Messenger of Allah know of the knowledge of things that he did not know at that night or what Jibril would bring to him at other times? The opposition will say, \"No, there  was nothing the Messenger of Allah did not know.\" Say to the opposition, \"Was it necessary  for the Messenger of Allah to express such knowledge?\" The opposition will say, \"No, it was  not necessary.\" Say to them, \"Was there any difference and disharmony in the knowledge that  the Messenger of Allah had received from Allah?\" If the opposition would say, \"No, there  was no disharmony, \" ask them, \"If one would judge by the laws of Allah with disharmony,  has he opposed the Messenger of Allah?\" They will say, \"Yes, he has opposed the Messenger  of Allah.\" However, if they say, \"No, he has not opposed the Messenger of Allah, they have  invalidated their starting point\". Say to them, \"No one knows its interpretation except Allah  and those who are well-grounded in knowledge.\"If they would ask, \"Who are the ones well-grounded in knowledge?\" Say, \"They are those in whose knowledge there is no disharmony.\" If they would ask, \"Who is he?\" Say, \"the  Messenger of Allah was such a person. Did he convey such knowledge to the first one  (Khalifa)?\" If they say, \"Yes, the Messenger of Allah did convey.\" Ask, \"Did the Messenger  of Allah die and the Khalifa after him had the knowledge free of disharmony ?\" If they would  say, \"No, there was no such Khalifa with the knowledge free of disharmony.\" Say, \"(This is  not logical.) The successor of the Messenger of Allah is supported (has the Divine support)  and the Messenger of Allah does not appoint a Khalifa who would not judge by the laws of  Allah. The Messenger of Allah will not appoint a Khalifa except one who is just like him,  excluding prophet-hood. If the Messenger of Allah did not appoint a Khalifa in his knowledge  anyone, he ( Allah forbid) caused to go astray the people of coming generations.\"\"If the opposition would say, \"The knowledge of the Messenger of Allah was from the Holy Quran.\" Say, \"What about the following verses of the holy Quran that speak about the matters  after the death of the Holy Prophet (s.a.), ‘I swear by the illustrious Book (44:2) that We have  revealed the Quran on a blessed night to warn mankind (44:3). On this night, every absolute  command coming from Us becomes distinguishable (44:4). The command that We have been  sending (44:5) as a mercy (for the human being) from your Lord. . . .’\" (44:6).\"If the opposition would say, \"Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, sends only prophets.\" Say, \"These distinguishable commands that come is from the angels and the spirit. They come  from one heaven to the other. In the heavens there is no one to whom obedience and  disobedience would apply.\" \"If the opposition would say, \"They come from the heavens to earth and the people of earth are in dire need of such commands.\"  Say to them, \"Is it necessary for them to have a leader who would judge among them?\" If they say, \"The Khalifa will judge for them.\" Ask them about the meaning of the following verse of  the Holy Quran. \"God is the Guardian of the believers and it is He who takes them out of  darkness into light. The Devil is the guardian of those who deny the Truth and he leads them  from light to darkness. These are the dwellers of hell wherein they will live forever.\" (2:257)\"I swear by my life that all those in the heavens and on earth who are under the guardian-ship of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, are supported (Divinely) and protected. Those who  are supported and protected do not make mistakes. All the enemies of Allah, the Most Holy,  the Most High, in the heavens and on earth suffer defeat. Those who are defeated they do not  deal in a rightful way. Just as it is necessary that the command must come from the heavens  for the people of earth in the same way it is necessary to have a Wali (one who possesses  Divine authority).\"\"If the opposition would say, \"We do not know such a person.\"Say to them, \"Say whatever you may like. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, disdains to leave, after Muhammad (s.a.) the servants without one who would possess Dinvine authority.\"The narrator has said that he then stopped and said, \"This, O child of the Messenger of Allah, is a delicate point. Consider if they would say, \"The Holy Quran is the Divine authority.\" The  Imam (a.s.) said, \"Then I will say, ‘The Holy Quran does not speak, issue commands and  prohibitions. The people of Quran issue commands and prohibitions. I would further say,  \"Allah would disdain to see a certain affliction (difficult issue) would befall to the people of  the earth, and there is no law about it in the Sunnah or a ruling free of differences and it is not  in the Quran. He would disdain to have such thing in His knowledge to take place on earth  and there would be nothing in His judgment to stop it from happening or the means to provide  relief.\"He then said, \"Here you gain victory, O child of the Messenger of Allah. I testify that Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, certainly knows what kinds of afflictions and sufferings may  befall people of the earth in their lives and in their religion etc. He then set the Holy Quran as  a guide.\" The narrator has said that the man then said, \"Do you, O child of the Messenger of  Allah, know what kind of guide it is ?\" Abu Ja‘far (a.s.) said said, \"Yes, in it there are the  general principles of laws and its interpretation when judgment would be issued. He said that  Allah disdains to see His servant is afflicted with hardships in his religion, his life or his  property and there would be no one on His earth whose judgment would decide truthfully and  in the right way to remove the suffering.\"The narrator has said that the man then said, \"In this matter you have gained victory unless your enemies would falsely ascribe lies to Allah and say, ‘Allah, the Most Holy, the Most  High, does not have anyone who would possess Divine authority.’ However, tell me about the   interpretation of: \". . . so that you would not grieve over what you have lost nor become extremely happy about what God has granted to you. . . .\" (57:23) The Imam (a.s.) said, \"It  refers to abu so and so and his people. One of the verses is placed before and the other is  placed afterwards (in two different places).\" Grief over the loss applies to Amir al-Mu’minin  Ali (a.s.) only’. \". . . nor become extremely happy about what God has granted to you. . .\"  refers to the mischief that you faced after the death of the Messenger of Allah. The man then said, \"I testify that you are the Divine authorities in whose judgment there is no disharmony.\" The man then stood up and went and I did not see him any more.\"",

He then asked, \"Do you know what made me laugh?\" The narrator has said that they  said, \"No, we do not know the reason.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Ibn ‘Abbass thinks he is of the  people mention in the following verse of the Holy Quran. \"To those who have said, \"God is  our Lord, \" and who have remained steadfast to their belief, the angels will descend saying,  \"Do not be afraid or grieved. Receive the glad news of the Paradise which was promised to  you.\" (41:30). I asked him, \"Have you seen the angels, O ibn ‘Abbass, telling you of the fact  that they guard and protect you in this and the next world and provide you complete  protection and security from fear and sadness?\" The Imam (a.s.) then said that ibn ‘Abbass  said, \"Believers are each other's brothers. . . .\" (49:10) the whole community is included in  this verse.\" I then laughed.\"Then I said, \"O ibn ‘Abbass, you (perhaps) are right. However, I ask you to swear to Allah and answer me truthfully. Is there any disharmony in the judgment of Allah, Majestic is  Whose mention?\" He said, \"No, there is no disharmony in His judgment.\"\"I then asked him, \"How would judge the case in which a man strikes the fingers of another man with a sword until they fall. Then another man comes and cuts off his palm. He is  brought to you and you are the judge. How would you then judge?\" He said, \"I will order the  one who cut off the palm to pay compensation for the whole hand. I will ask the affected  party to reach a settlement with the defendant and for this purpose I send them to the people  of justice (arbitrator).\" I said, \"(In your judgment) disharmony has come in the laws of Allah,  Majestic is Whose mention, thus, you invalidated what you said before (that there is no  disharmony in the laws and judgment of Allah). Allah, Majestic is Whose mention, disdains  to let a judicial case remain on earth without a clarified rule. You must order, as a judge, to  cut the palm of the defendant totally and pay compensation for the fingers. Thus, is the  judgment of Allah at the night wherein His orders descend. If you would reject after hearing  from the Messenger of Allah then Allah will send you to fire just as He blinded you on the   day you hid the (truth) in favor of Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.).\" Ibn ‘Abbass then said, \"Is that why my eyes have become blind?\" He further said, \"How would you know that? I swear by  Allah that my eyes turned blind only because of the flapping of the wing of the angel.\" The  Imam (a.s.) said, \"That made me laugh. I left him that day because of the silliness (dark and  dullness) in his intellect and reason. I then met him latter and said to him, \"O ibn ‘Abbass,  you have not spoken as true as you did yesterday. Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) told you that the  Night of Determination comes every year. On that night the command for the whole year  comes down. For that matter and command is the people with Divine authority after the  Messenger of Allah. You then asked, \"Who are these people?\" He (Ali (a.s.) said, \"I myself  and the eleven men from my descendents will be the Imams (leaders with divine authority)  and the (people to whom angels speak) Muhaddathun.\" You then said, \"I do not see it (Night  of Determination) except with the Messenger of Allah.

His (Ali’s ) eyes did not see him  (the angel) but his heart understood (the presence of the angel) and he impacted his ears. Then  he (angel) flapped you with his wing and you turned blind.\" Ibn ‘Abbass then said, \"In the  matters that we dispute it is up to Allah to judge.\" I then said to him, \"Has Allah judged one  case with two judgments?\" He replied, \"No, Allah has not done so.\" I then said, \"Here you  perish and cause others to perish.\"",

Absolute and strong command is not two things. It is only  one thing. One who judges without disharmony and differences his judgment is of the  judgment of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High. Whoever would judge in disharmonious  manner with differences and considers it as the rightful way of judging he has judged with the  judgment of the devil.It is certain that on the Night of Determination the explanation and clarification of all issues of the year comes to the man who possesses Divine authority. On that Night the Wali al-’Amr  (the man who possesses Divine authority) receives commands about his self for so and so,  and about the affairs of the people in so and so. It also is certain that for the man with Divine  authority, besides this, every year, there comes the knowledge of Allah, the Most Holy, the  Most High. (There comes to him) the exclusive knowledge, the hidden, the wonderful and the  treasured knowledge of Allah. It comes just in the Night of Determination comes the  command.

He has also  said in His book, \"Muhammad is only a Messenger. There lived other Messengers before him.  Should (Muhammad) die or be slain, would you then turn back to your pre-Islamic behavior?  Whoever does so can cause no harm to God. God will reward those who give thanks.\" (3:144)  In the verse He has said that when Muhammad will die the opposition to the command of  Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, will say , \"The Night of Determination has gone along  with the Messenger of Allah.\" This is the first clamity that has befallen them exclusively.  With this they returned back to their old ways. Had they not said so, it would have been  necessary to believe that Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has His commands on that  Night. Once they would affirm and acknowledge the command (delegation of Divine  authority) it would have become necessary to believe in the existence of the man who  possesses Divine authority.\"",

It is for the  matters of which they already had knowledge, but they receive the command as how to act in  it.\" The man said, \"Explain it to me.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"The Messenger of Allah, before  his death had a whole of knowledge with its interpretation.\" You said, \"What was that which  that would come to him in the ‘Night of Determination’?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"It was the  command and ease in what he already knew.\" The man questioning said, \"What then happens  to them in the ‘Night of Determination’ is a knowledge other than what they knew before.\"  The Imam (a.s.) said, \"This is what they are commanded not to tell to anyone. No one knows  the interpretation of what you just asked except Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High.The man questioning asked, \"Do the executors of the know what the prophets know?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"No, because how would the executor of the will would know what is other  than what is willed for.\"The man asked, \"Can we say that what one executor of the will may know may not be known another executor of the will?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"No, because no prophet dies before his  knowledge is transferred into the executor of his will. The angels and the Spirit descend in the  ‘Night of Determination’ with the judgment with which to judge among the people.\" The man  asked, \"Is it that they did not know that judgment?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Yes, they knew it  but they could not approve anything of it until they were commanded in the ‘Night of  Determination’ how to accomplish them until the next year.\" The man said, \"O abu Ja‘far (a. s.) I can not deny this.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Those who deny it is not from us.\"The man asked, \"O abu Ja‘far (a.s.), do you think in the ‘Night of Determination’ there would come things to the Holy Prophet (s.a.) that he did not know?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"It is not  lawful for you to ask this. However, the knowledge of things in past and the knowledge of the  things in future is as such that no prophet or the executor of the dies before the executor of  will after him would know it. However, this know about which you ask is as such that Allah,  the Most Holy, the Most High, withholds and does not allow the executors of the will to know  it by themselves.\" The man asked, \"O child of the Messenger of Allah, how would I know  that the ‘Night of Determination’ take place every year?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"When the  month of Ramadan comes read",

"Content": "The narrator has said that abu Ja‘far (a.s.) said the following. \"You, certainly, find those whom Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has sent to induce misfortune into the heretics  and misleading people of the army (followers) of Satan and their companions in greater  numbers than those sent to the deputy of Allah, sent for justice and truth from among the  angels.\" (In other words, the devils sent to induce bad luck into the heretics are in greater  number than the angels sent with guidance to the people of Divine authority).It was said to him, \"O abu Ja‘far (a.s.), \"How can there be anything in greater number than the angels?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"It is just as Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has wished.\"The man asked, \"O abu Ja‘far (a.s.), \"If I will narrate this Hadith to a few of your followers they will reject it.\" The Imam (a.s.) asked, \"Why they will do so?\" The man said, \"They will  say that the angels are of greater number than the Devils.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"What say is  true. However, try to understand what I will say.\" There is no day or night in which all the  Devils and all Satans would not visit the heretic and misleading leaders and of the same  number the angels visit the Imam of true guidance (leaders who possess Divine authority)  until it is the ‘Night of Determination’. On that night of the angels descend to those who  possess Divine authority in a number equal to the number of the Devils and Satan that Allah  has created- or he said, has determined.The Devils and Satans will come to the corrupt misleading authorities with fabrications and lies until the perhaps dawn and say, \"I saw, this night, such and such.\" However, if he would  ask about it the one who possesses Divine authority, he would say, \"You have seen a Satan  who has informed of you such and such. (It is the Devil’s thing) until he provides him with  one or the other interpretation and teach him the ways how to mislead people. The misleading  conditions in which he lives. I swear by Allah, those who acknowledge the ‘Night of  Determination’ they will certainly know that it (the ‘Night of Determination’ is exclusively  for us. It is because of th words of the Messenger of Allah to Ali (a.s.) when the time of his  death was about to approach, \"This is you guardian who possess Divine authority after me. If  you will obey him, you will enjoy a well guided way of life. However, those who would not  acknowledge what is in the ‘Night of Determination’ they would be unbelievers in it. Those  who would have faith in the ‘Night of Determination’ but do not hold the opinion that we do,  for them to verify it, there is no other way but to say that it the ‘Night of Determination’ is for  us and those would not acknowledge it they would be only liars. Allah, the Most Holy, the  Most High, is by far exalted than to send the angles with the Spirit to a sinful unbeliever. If  such people would say that they (angels with the Spirit) come to the Khalifa in whom  believes, this would be of no ground. If they would say, \"No one descends at that night to  anyone.\" The fact is that something does come to nothing. If they say or will say, \"This is  nothing.\" They have, certainly, strayed far away from the truth.\"",

They acknowledge us as the Divine authority over themselves, accept us as their Imam and  say that obedience to us is obligatory just as is the case with the Messenger of Allah. They  then destroy the veracity of their belief as such and dispute against their own selves due to  weakness of their hearts. They then diminish our right and blame those whom Allah has  granted evidence to know us as it should be and the (abulity) to submit themselves to our  Divine authority. Do you not consider that how would Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High,  make it obligatory to obey those who possess Divine authority over his servants and then hide  from them (people who possess Divine authority) `the new of the heaves and the earth? How  would He cut them off of the sources of knowledge that might come to them to maintain their  religion?\" Humran then said to the Imam (a.s.), \"May Allah, take my soul in service for your  cause, how would you explain the case of the uprising of Ali ibn abu Talib, al-Hassan and al- Husayn (a.s.)? They came out and rose up for the cause of Allah, Whose mention is so  Majestic. How much they suffered and how mercilessly were they murdered at the hands of  the rebels? They were defeated, murdered and over powered.\" Abu Ja‘far (a.s.) then said, \"O  Humran, Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, had determined it on them. He had decreed,  approved and made it unavoidable though the voluntary manner. He then allowed to take  place. It, thus, happened with a pre-existing knowledge that had come to them from the  Messenger of Allah. Ali al-Hassan and al-Husayn (a.s.) rose up for the cause of Allah with  full knowledge of the consequences and remained silent from us those who remained silent.  Had they, O Humran, when facing what Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, made them to  face and suffer defeat at the hands of the rebels, asked Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High,  to remove their suffering and would implore Him to destroy the government and kingdom of  the rebels He would have answered their prayers and would grant them relief. In such case the  destruction of the governments of the rebels and the ending of their time would take place  quicker than the dispersal under a great pressure, of beads threaded together. The suffering, O  Humran, that befell them, because of the sins that they might have committed or the  punishment for their opposition to Allah. It was because of the high marvelous position that  Allah had prepared and wanted them to reach. Do not let people’s opinions take you away  from the right path.\"",

Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, said, \". . .what the Messenger (of  Allah) you, you must take (obey) and what he prohibits you, you must desist from. . .\" (59:7)  The Messenger of Allah was protected, successful and supported by the Holy Spirit. He (the  Messenger of Allah) does not slip, make a mistake in any of the matters of the management of  the social matters of the creatures. He is educated with the education of Allah. Allah, the Most  Holy, the Most High, commanded to perform the prayer in two and two Rak‘at form totalling  ten Rak‘ats. The Messenger of Allah added two more Rak‘ats to each prayer and only one  Rak‘at to the Maghrib prayer (the prayer at sun set). Such additions became just as the  obligatory ones and it is not permissible to disregard them. They are obligatory at home and  on a journey. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, granted him permission in all of it. Thus,  the obligatory prayers became seventeen Rak‘ats. The Messenger of Allah then setup the  tradition of optional prayers totaling thirty four Rak‘ats which is double the number of the  optional prayers. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, granted him permission for this. All  the optional and obligatory prayers total fifty one Rak‘ats of which there is two Rak‘ats in a  sitting position after (al-‘atma) ‘Isha prayer which is counted as one Rak‘at in place of Witr.  Allah made fasting of the month of Ramadan obligatory which comes only once in a year.  The Messenger of Allah set up the tradition of fasting in the month of Sha‘ban and three days   fasting of every month and the number of days in it totals twice as much as the obligatory fast. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, granted him permission for all of this. Allah, the  Most Holy, the Most High, made just wine unlawful to consume. The Messenger of Allah  pronounced all intoxicants drinks unlawful. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, granted him  permission in this case also. The Messenger of Allah pronounced certain things as permissible  and pronounced other things as detestable but did not declare them prohibited as unlawful. He  only pronounced them prohibited in a permissible prohibition and detestable. He then spoke  of such prohibitions as permissible but then such permissible matters became obligatory for  the servants (of Allah) like the obligation of abiding by what is prohibited and determined.  The Messenger of Allah did not grant permission in the matters that were prohibited as  unlawful (to violate) prohibitions or what he pronounced as an order to follow as an  obligation and binding. A great deal of the intoxicants drinks he pronounced as unlawful to  consume and he did not grant permission to any one to consume them. The Messenger of  Allah did not grant permission to anyone to further shorten the prayers tha consisted of two  Rak‘ats that were added to what Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, had made obligatory.  In fact, He made them binding and necessary like an obligation. He did not grant permission  to anyone in this matter except those on a journey. No one has the right to give permission in  such issues until the Messenger of Allah grants permission. Thus, the order of the Messenger  of Allah concord the orders of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High. The prohibitions of the  Messenger of Allah concord the prohibition of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High. It has  become obligatory for the servants (of Allah) to submit to his commands as it is obligatory for  them to submit to the command of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High.\"",

Among the members of the family members of David there was a son whose mother lived with David and he loved her very  much. David came to her when the Divine inspiration came to him and he said to her, Allah,  the Most Holy, the Most High, has sent me inspirations and He wants me to appoint the  executor of my will from among the members of my family. His wife asked him to appoint  her son for this task. He said, \"I also want what you said. \" In the foregone knowledge of  Allah it was already decisively existed that executor of the will of David is Solomon. Allah,  the Most Holy, the Most High, sent inspiration to David commanding him not to made hasty  decisions before the coming of His order. It was not long after that two man came to David to  settle a dispute over the sheep and grapes among them. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High,  sent inspiration to David to gather all of his sons together and let them judge the case.  Whoever of your sons then would judge the case rightly he will be the executor of your will.  David gathered all his sons. When the case was stated Solomon said, \"O owner of grapes,  when did the sheep of this man enter your vinyard?\" He replied, \"They entered at night.\"  Solomon said, \"O owner of sheep, I have judged against you. You must give the young and  the wool of your sheep to him this year.\" David then said, \"Why did you not judge giving  away of the very sheep as the because the Israelite scholars have already evaluated them and  the price of sheep is the value of grapes?\" Solomon answered, \"The vines are not consumed  from their roots but only the fruit is consumed that will come back in future.\" Allah, the Most  Holy, the Most High, sent inspiration to David that the judgment in this case is the judgment  of Solomon. O David, \"You wanted one thing and We had wanted other than that. David  came to his wife and said, \"We wanted one thing but Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High,  wanted a thing other than that.

This legacy of Abraham is for Ali (a.s.) and your descendents from his lineage.\"  The Imam (a.s.) has said, \"The document had several seals on it.\" The Imam (a.s.) has further  said, \"Ali (a.s.) opened the first seal and followed what the instructions therein. Then al- Hassan (a.s.) opened the second seal and followed the commandments and instructions  therein. When al-Hassan (a.s.) passed away then al-Husayn (a.s.) opened the third seal and  found therein instruction to fight to do away with the enemy and be murdered and rise up  (against the enemy) with a group of people for martyrdom. There will be martyrdom for them  without you.\" The Imam (a.s.) has said, \"Al-Husayn (a.s.) followed the instructions (entirely)  and when he left this world he delivered it to Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.) just before his  martyrdom. Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.) opened the fourth seal and found in it instruction to  remain silent and gaze in your front because of the concealment of knowledge. Just before his  passing away he delivered it to Muhammad ibn Ali (a.s.). He opened the fifth seal and found  therein instructions to interpret the book of Allah, the Most High, affirm veracity of your  father and leave it as your legacy for your son. Do good to the ’Umma (nation), stand up for  right of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, say the truth in fear and in peace and do not be  afraid of anyone except Allah. He did as he was instructed and delivered it to the succeeding  Imam.\" The narrator has said that he said to the Imams (a.s.), \"May Allah take my soul in  service for your cause, are you then the succeeding Imam?\" The narrator has said that the  Imams (a.s.) then said, \"There is nothing wrong in a positive answer to your question except  if then you would go, O Mu‘adh, and narrate to people thing that would harm me.\" The  narrator has said that he then said to the Imams (a.s.), \"I pray to Allah who has granted you  this through your noble ancestors this high position to grant to your successor the same high  position before you will die.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Allah has already done so, O Mu‘adh.\"   The narrator has said that he then asked the Imams (a.s.), \"Who then he is, \"May Allah take my soul in service for your cause?\" The Imam (a.s.) replied, \"This sleeping one. He pointed  with his hand to the righteous servant of Allah who was asleep (Musa ibn Ja‘far (a.s.).\"",

Jibril brought it along with the  trustees of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, from among the angels. Jibril then said, \"O  Muhammad (s.a) order every one to leave you except the executor of your will so he can take  possession of the same and make us to bear witness that you delivered it to him and he (Ali (a. s.), take charge of the same in our presence. The Holy Prophet (s.a) ordered everyone else,  except Ali (a.s.). Fatima was present between the door and the curtain. Jibril then said, \"O  Muhammad, your Lord declares peace and safety to you and says, \"This is the documentation  of My covenant that I had made with you, the conditions that I had set up and I had made My  angels to bear witness to it. In fact, O Muhammad, I Myself am sufficient as a witness.\" The  Imam (a.s.) has said, \"At that time all the joints in the body of Muhammad began to shake and  shiver. He then said, \"O Jibril my lord Himself is peace, from Him comes peace and to Him  returns peace. He, Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has spoken the truth and has granted  favors. Please allow me to have the document.\" Jibril then delivered it to him and commanded  him to deliver it to Amir al-Mu’minin Ali (a.s.). He asked Ali (a.s.) to read it. He then read it  word by word. The Prophet (s.a) then said, \"O Ali (a.s.), this is the covenant of my Lord, the  Most Holy, the Most High, to me and His conditions upon me and His trust with me. I have  now delivered it, given good-advise and fulfilled my responsibility.\" Ali (a.s.) then said, \"I  testify in your favor, may Allah take my soul and the souls of my parents in service for your  cause, for delivering the trust, granting good advise and affirmation of your speaking the  truth. My ears, my eyes, my flesh and my blood all bear witness to this.\" Jibril then said, \"I  also am of the witnesses to this fact for both of you.\" The Messenger of Allah (s.a) then said,  \"O Ali, have you taken possession of my will, learned its contents and offered a guarantee to  Allah and to me to follow the instructions therein?\" Ali (a.s.) then said, \"Yes, ‘may Allah take  my soul and the souls of my parents in service for your cause, it is my responsibility to follow  the instructions therein and from Allah comes support for me and my success in the  fulfillment of my responsibility.\" The Messenger of Allah then said, \"O Ali, I would like to  ask you to bear testimony to my promise of rewarding for it (your executing my will) on the  Day of Judgment.\" Ali (a.s.) said, \"Yes, I do bear such testimony.\" The Prophet (s.a) then  said, \"Jibril and Mika’il are between us now and with them present are the prominent angels.   Would you agree if I would ask them to bear testimony to this fact?\" He then said, \"Yes, they may bear testimony and I, may Allah take my soul and the souls of my parents in service for  your cause, also ask them to bear testimony.\" Then the Messenger of Allah made them to bear  testimony. Of the matters that the Messenger of Allah set as condition up on Ali (a.s.) on  orders from Jibril of the commands of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, were the  following. He said, \"O Ali, you must follow the instruction in the will about loving those who  love Allah and His Messenger and to disdain and maintain unfriendly attitude towards those  who are enemies of Allah and His Messenger. It requires patience on your part and control  over your anger for the usurpation of my right and the usurpation of one fifth that belongs to  you and for the disregard of your respect and honor.\" Ali (a.s.) then said, \"Yes, O the  Messenger of Allah, I accept it (this condition). Ali (a.s.) has said, \"I swear by the One Who  helps the seed to burst open and shapes the fetuses that I heard Jibril say to the Prophet (s.a)  this. \"O Muhammad, explain to him that people will disregard his respect and honor which is  the respect and honor of Allah and His Messenger and that his beard will be tainted with fresh  blood (from his head).\" Amir al-Mu’minin Ali (a.s.) has said, \"A loud sigh came out of my  mouth when I understood the very words of Jibril, the trustworthy one. I fell up on my face to  the ground and I said, \"Yes, I accept and agree even if it will end up to the disregard of  respect and honor. (I agree) even if (people) will disregard the noble traditions, insult the  Book, destroy the Ka‘ba and taint my beard with fresh blood from my head. (I accept it) with  patience and leave to Allah for judgement for all times until I will arrive to meet you.\" The Messenger of Allah then called Fatima, al-Hassan and al-Husayn to his presence and informed them of what he had explained to Amir al-Mu’minin Ali (a.s.). They all said just  like what Ali (a.s.) had said. The will was then sealed with the seals of gold that fire had not  touched. It was delivered to Amir al-Mu’minin Ali (a.s.).\" The narrator has said that he asked  the Imam abu al-Hassan (a.s.), \"May Allah take my soul and the souls of my parents in  service for your cause, would you please describe what was there in the will?\" The Imam (a. s.) said, \" It contained the traditions of Allah and the traditions of His Messenger.\" I then  asked, \"Was there anything about their attacking and opposition to Amir al-Mu’minin Ali (a. s.)?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \" Yes, I swear by Allah, all and every thing was there letter by  letter. Have you not heard the words of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, \"It is We who  bring the dead to life and record the deeds of human beings and their consequences (of  continual effects). We keep everything recorded in an illustrious Imam (Book).\" (36:12)I swear by Allah that the Messenger of Allah said to Amir al-Mu’minin Ali (a.s.) and Fatima, \"Did you understand well my presentation of the matter to you and did you agree to and  accept it?

It, in  fact, was the Messenger of Allah who explained to them this matter. The command for Zakat  (a form of income tax) came to the Messenger of Allah and there was no specific taxable  number such as one Dirham on every forty Dirham.

The Messenger of Allah  then said about Ali (a.s.), \"On whoever I have Divine Authority, then Ali (a.s.) has Divne  Authority over him also.\" He also has said, \"I enjoin you to follow the book of Allah and my  family because have prayed to Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High not to separate these two  from eachother until He will make them arrive al-Kawthar (at the pool of Paradise) to meet  me. He has granted my prayer as such.\" The Holy Prophet (s.a.) has said, \"Do not try to teach  them (The Imam (a.s.) becaue they are far more knowledgeable than you.\" The Holy Prophet  (s.a.) has said, \"The Imam (a.s.) will never take you out of the gate of guidance and they  never make you enter the gate of misguidance.\" Had the Messenger of Allah remained silent  and would not explain anything about his Ahl al-Bayt (family) the family of so and so would  have advanced their claim for Imamat (Leadership with Divine Authority). However, Allah,  the Most Holy, the Most High, has revealed it in His book to confirm the explanantions of His  Prophet about Ahl al-Bayt (in the following verse), \"People of the house, God wants to  remove all kinds of uncleanliness from you and to purify you thoroughly.\" (33:33) Ali,  Fatima, al-Hassan andlhy (a.s.) were there and the Holy Prophet (s.a.) made them to enter  under al-Kisa’ (the Cloack) in the house of ’Umm salama and then said, \"O Lord, every   prophet has a family and a gravity, and these are my family and gravity.\" ’Umm Salama at this point said, \"Am I not of your family?\" The Holy Prophet (s.a.) said, \"You are in goodness  but these are my family and my gravity.\" Whe the Messenger of Allah passed away Ali (a.s.)  had the utmost priority and guardianship of the people all because of what the Messenger of  Allah had preached about him. It was because of raising him up for the people and holding his  hand in his hand. When Ali (a.s.) (was about to) passed away he could not (and would not)  enter Muhammad ibn Ali or al-‘Abbass ibn Ali or anyone of his other sons in the position of  Imamt.

The Messenger of Allah has  preached to people about us just as he has done so about you. Allah has removed al-Rijs  uncleanliness from us just as He has done so to you. When Ali (a.s.) left this world, al-Hassan  had the utmost priority for Imamat (Leadership with Divine Authority) because he was the  eldest. When was about to die he could not, and would not, enter his sons in the position of  Imamat.It is because ;Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, says, \". . . The relatives are closer  to each other, according to the Book of God, than the believers and the emigrants. . .\" (33:6)  He then places Imamat (Leadership with Divine Authority) in his sons.

The Messenger of Allah has preached to people  about me just as he has preached to people about you and your father. Allah has removed al- Rijs (unleanliness) from me just as He has removed from you and your father.

Then (the fasting) of the month of  Ramadan, between (the months of ) Sha'ban and Shawwal, was sent down. Then hajj was sent  down, and Jibril (p.b.uh.) came down and said:\"Inform them of their hajj as you informed  them of their prayer, their Rabat and their fasting.\" Then the Mastership was sent down, and  when this came to him on Friday at 'Arafah (or 'Arafat, the gathering place for the pilgrims on  the 9th of Dhu 'l-Hijjah, near Mecca), Allah, to Whom belong Might and Majesty, sent down:  Today I have completed your religion for you, and I have perfected My blessing upon you (al- Ma'idah,5:3). The completion of the religion was through the Mastership of Ali ibn Abu Talib  (p.b.uh.). Then the Messenger of Allah (pb.uh.ah.p.) said together with this (verse): \"My  community has recently experienced the jahiliyyah (the period of ignorance before Islam),  and whenever I inform them of this concerning my cousin, one speaker will say this and  another will say that. I say (this) to myself without my tongue speaking out: a decisive  obligation came to me from Allah, to Whom belong Might and Majesty, with finality; He  threatened me that if I did not make (this) reach (the people), He would punish me.\" Then was  sent down: O Messenger, deliver that which has been sent down to thee from thy Lord; for if  thou cost not, thou wilt not have delivered His Message. Allah will protect thee from men.  Allah guides not the people of the unbelievers (al-Matidah, S :67).

I shall be questioned and you will be questioned, and what will you say?\" They said:  \"We bear witness that you have delivered (what you had to deliver) and advised sincerely,  and conveyed what you had. May Allah reward you with the best of the rewards of those who  were messengers.\" He said: \"O Allah, I call you to witness\"—three times —then he said: \"O  assembly of believers, that this man is your Master (wall) after me. Let the one among you  who witnesses this convey (what he has seen) to the one who is absent.\" ' Abu Ja'far (p.b.u.h.)  said: 'By Allah, (Ali—p.b.u.h.) was the one trusted by Allah over His creation, His unseen  (commands), and His religion which He Himself accepted (for His creatures).

But he would not have done this.  Allah, to Whom belong Might and Majesty, said: Some of those bound by blood are nearer  (to each other) than others (al-Anfal,8:75; al-Ahzab, 33 :6).\" This is about us and about our   sons.' \"APPENDIXThere are some matters in the ahddith nos. 687 and 689 which need clarification in order to solve their apparent contradiction.1. The root gh-b-r is one of those which in Arabuc are called added, that is, they have two contrary meanings. One meaning of this word, which is \"to have remained\" or \"to have  lasted\\\\",",")", is opposite to its second meaning, which is \"to have passed\" or \"to have gone away\".  Thus the nomen agentis, ghdbir, can take either of these two meanings, both of which are well  recorded in original linguistic sources, and there is thus a kind of homonymy in which the two  meanings oppose one another. ( See al -Asma'i, al-Addad,p. 58; as- Sijistani, al-Adddd,  pp.153 - 154; Ibn Sikkit, al-Adddd, p. 240; al-Anbari, al-Addad, p. 129; Abu 't.-Tayyib al- Halabu, al-Adddd f' kalami '1-'Arab, vol. 2, pp. 527 - 530; Lisdau '1- Arab, vol. 5, pp. 3 - 7;  Tdju '1-'arus, vol. 3, pp.436 - 439).2. The description of knowledge ('ilm) can be made according to three divisions: the knower, the known, and the cause of knowledge. In the second and third divisions, there are three sub- divisions: past, present and future. Thus knowledge may be described as, for example, past in  two senses: past according to the cause, for example, I know now because I learnt it  yesterday; or past according to what is known, for example, I know what happened yesterday.  Similarly with present and future knowledge.3. In the first of the two ahddith (no. 687), knowledge is divided into three categories: mddin, ghibir and hddith. Since ghdbir is here contrasted with mddin (past), it clearly has the sense  we first mentioned, that is, that of continuation. In the second hadith (no.689), knowledge  again has a three-fold division, this time into gEdbir, mazbdr and that \"which has been  pricked in (our) hearts. . .\"; hddith was defined in this way in the first hadith. As for gEdbir  and mazbdr, in the first hadith they are given as equivalents, but in the second they are two  separate divisions. From the-explanations given it is clear that mazbdr has the same sense (i. e., written down) in both abddith, thus we must conclude that ghdbir is used in the first hadith  with the sense of mazbdr, and in the second with the sense of mddin. Since we already know  that gEdbir has two meanings, this difference can be accounted for by its homonymity.4. The sense of mddin in the first hadith is given as that which has been explained (mufassar), and thus refers to the cause of the knowledge being in the past, while the more obvious sense,  that is, knowledge of what has happened, was probably too clear to require explanation. In the  second hadith, ghdbir is explained as that which was before, which must mean \"before\" in  both senses, that is, by cause, and of previous events. Thus mddin in the first and ghdbir in the  second hadith have the same sense, that is, knowledge through what preceeded and  knowledge of what preceeded. In the second kind of knowledge, that is, gEdbir in the first   hadith and mazbdr in the first and second, the explanations given show that the cause of this knowledge is its being written down (marbdr); this is the definition given in the first hadith,  but in the second, mazbdr is itself explained as being knowledge of what will happen to us  (md ya'tind), which is a description according to what is known. Thus it is clear that this  second kind of knowledge has been caused previously, but is of events which are going to  happen in the future. It is also clear that this written knowledge is precisly what was  mentioned in the ahidith in",

To  Allah, the Most High belong all the good choice. He chooses whoever He wants from  whomever He wants. He gave the glad news about Jesus to Moses and Yusha‘. When Allah,  the Most Holy, the Most High, raised Jesus as His Messenger Jesus said to them, \"After there  will come a prophet whose name will be Ahmad from the descendents of Isma‘il (a.s.). He  will come and affirm my message and your message, my excuses and your excuses. (The  will) will continued after him in the disciples the conservative ones. Allah, the Most High, has  called them as conservative ones because they preserved the greatest name and it is the book  through which such knowledge of all things is learned that existed with the prophets (s.a.) as  Allah, the Most High, has said the following. \"We sent Our Messengers (before you ) with  clear evidence (to support their truthfulness), and sent with them the Book and the  Balance . . .\" (57:25). The book is the greatest name. Of what is known as the books are  Torah, Gospel and al-Furqan (the Holy Quran ) of which also is the book of Noah, the book  of Salih, shu‘ayb and Abraham. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has said,\"This is what is written in the ancient heavenly Books,(87:18) the Scriptures of Abraham and   Moses (87:19). Where then is the book of Abraham? In fact, the book of Abraham is the greatest name. The book of Moses is thegreatest name. Thus, the will continues through one  scholar to the next scholar until they delivered it to Muhammad (s.a.) \"When Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, sent Muhammad (s.a.) the descendents of the conservative disciples accepted his faith but the lyinng of the Israelites refused to believe in  him. He prayed to Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, and worked hard for His cause.  Thereafter Allah, Most High is Whose mention, commanded him to declare the excellence of  the executor of your will and he said, \"My Lord, the Arabs are the most rude and unjust ones.  They did not have anybooks with them, no prophet had come to them and they do not know  the virtues of the prophcy of the prophets (s.a.) and their honor. They will not believe me if I  would declare to them the excellence and virtues of my family. Allah, Most Holy the mention  of Whose name is, said, \"Do not be grieved about them . . .\" (16:127) \". . .We have told him,  \"Ignore them and say to them 'farewell'. They will soon know the consequences of their deeds  (43:89) He has made a mention of the name of the executor of his will and hypocrisy fell into  their hearts. The Messenger of Allah noticed it and whatever they would say. Allah, the Most  Holy, the Most High, sais, \"O Muhammad (s.a.) We know that what they say causes tension  to your heart. They, in fact, do not reject what you say, but they refuse to accept the signs of  Allah. However, they refuse to accept them without any good reason and authority. The the  Messenger of Allah would associate with them and would seek the support of some of them  against the other ones among them. He would continue to express the excepllence of the  executor of his will to them fromtime to time until the following cchapter of the Holy Quran  was revealed. He presented justifications against them when he was informed of death to  approach and the news leaving this world. Allah, Most Holy, is the mention of Whose name,  said, \"When you are free from (your obligations), strive hard (to worship God) (94:7) and be  devoted to your Lord's service.\" (94:8). Allah says, \"When your duty is fulfilled then establish  your mark and symbol and declare who the executor of will, will be and speak to them of his  excellence and virtues. Thus, Muhammad (s.a.) declared, \"Over whoever I have Divine  Authority this Ali also has Divine Authority over them. O Lord, support those who would  support him and be the enemy of those who are hostile to him three time.\" He has further said,  \"I will commision and send the man who loves Allah and His Messenger and Allah and His  Messenger love him. He is not the one who would run away from the battle field. In this he  points out to the one who returned from the gates of the castle frightening and disheartening  his people. He has also said, \"Ali is the leader of the believers. Ali is the pillar of religion.\"  He has further said, \"This is the one who strikes people with his sword to defend the truth  after me.\" The Holy Prophet has said, \"The truth is with Ali wherever he would incline.\" The  Holy Prophet has said, \"I leave among two facts, would you hold to them firmly, you will  never be mislead, the book of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, and my family, my  descendents. O people, listen. I have certainly preached the message to you. You will arrive at  the pool of al-kawthar, and will ask you about your dealings towards the two graviticious  matters. The two graviticious matters are the book of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High,  and my family. Do not proceed ahead othem lest you will be destroyed. Do not try to treach  them because they by far are more knowledgeable than you.  Even though al-Hujja (solid proof of Ali’s Wilaya his Divine Authority over the people after the Holy Prophet) was established through the words of the the Messenger of Allah and those  of the Book that people read, however, he continued to express the excellence and spiritual  virtues of his family in words and explain with verses of the Holy Quran. \"People of the  house, God wants to remove all kinds of uncleanliness from you and to purify you  thoroughly. (33:33) \"Know that whatever property you may gain, one fifth belongs to God,  the Messenger, the kindred,. . .\" (8:41) \"Give the relatives, the destitute and those who when  on a journey have become needy, their dues. \" (17:26) It was Ali (a.s.) and his right was the  chance to execute the will of the Holy Prophet (s.a.) that gave him the Leadership with Divine  Authority which was created for him, the greatest name, the legacy of knowledge and the  symbols of knowledge of the prophet-hood. He also has said, \"(Muhammad), say, \"I do not  ask you for any payment for my preaching to you except (your) love of(my near)  relatives.. . .\" (42:23). \"questions are asked about the baby girls buried alive,\" (81:8) He says,  \"I ask you about the love that I had told you about its great virtue. It was the love of the  relatives (family of the Holy Prophet) but for what reason did you murder them. He, Most  Exalted Whose mention is, has said, \"Ask those who know about the heavenly Books if you  do not know about this.\" (16:43) He has said that the Book is the reminder and people of this  reminder (the book) are the Ahl –al-Bayt of Muhammad (s.a.). Allah, the Most Holy, the  Most High, has commanded them to ask from but theyare not commanded to ask the ignorant  people. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has called the Holy Quran Dhikr (reminder),  thus, He has said, \"We have revealed the Quran to you so that you could tell the people what  has been revealed to them and so that perhaps they will think.\" (16:44) Allah, the Most Holy,  the Most High, \"The Quran is a reminder to you and to your people and you will soon be  questioned about it.\" (43:44) Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has alsosaid, \"Believers,  obey God, His Messenger, and your leaders (who possess Divine authority). . .\" (4:59) He has  said, \"Had they referred it to the Messenger or to their leaders (who possess Divine,Authority)  they could have used that information more properly. Were it not for the favor and mercy of  God, all but a few of them would have followed Satan. (4:83)The referring of the matter and the task mentioned in the above verse is reffering in the task and the affairs of the people. People must referred in such tasks to the people who possess  Ddivine Authority from among them. The people that Allah has commanded to be obeyed and  referred to.When the Messenger of Allah returned from the his farewell piligrimage to the sacred House in Makka Jibril descended to him and said, \"Messenger, preach what is revealed to you from  your Lord. If you will not preach, it would be as though you have not conveyed My message.  God protects you from men. He does not guide the unbelieving people.\" (5:67) He called the people to come together at one place and they did. He ordered that the spiky bushes be removed from the ground to make room. He (s.a.) then said, \"O people, who is your guardian with divine Authority who has greater priority to your souls than yourselves?\" They said,  Allah and His Messenger have such authority.\" The Holy Prophet (s.a.) then said, \"Over   whoever I have Divine Authority this Ali also has the same degree of authority. O Lord support those who support him (Ali) and be the enemy of those who are his (Ali’s) enemies.  He said this three times. This made the thorn of hyposcrisy to deep itself into the hearts of  certain group of people who said, \"Allah, Most Great is His to mention, has never sent any  such thing to Muhammad (s.a.). He only wants to left up the shoulder of His nephew to  promote him. when he arrived at madina, the Ansar, Muslims of Madina came to see him for  a certain issue. They said, \"O the Messenger of Allah, Allah, Most great the mention of  Whose name is, has granted usa great deal of favors. He has granted us honor in bringing you  to this town among us. In so doing He has brought joy to the hearts of our friend and sorrow  to our enemies. We know that many delegates come to see you and there is not enough to give  them and the enemies call it degrading. We would like very much if you would accept one  third of our properties so that when a delegate from Makka 2would come to see you, you  would find enough means to accommodate them. The Messenger of Allah did not reply them  with anything and he was waiting for Jibril to come from his Lord. Jibril descended and said,  \". . .(Muhammad), say, \"I do not ask you for any payment for my preaching to you except  (your) love of(my near) relatives. . .\" (42:23) He did not accept their property. The hypocrites  said, \"Allah has not sent this to Muhammad. He only wants to left up the shoulder of his  nephew to promote him. He is imposing his family up on us. Yesterday he said, \"Over  whoever I have Divine authority, this Ali also has the same degree of Divine authority over  them and today he says, \".(Muhammad), say, \"I do not ask you for any payment for my  preaching to you except (your) love of(my near) relatives. . . .\" (42:23) Thereafter the verse of the Holy Quran about Khums (paying one fifth of net income as tax came (see 8:41) They said, \"He only wants to take away our properties and interests.\" Then  Jibril came and said, \"O Muhammad (s.a.) you have completed the task of prophet-hood and  the duration of your life is coming to a close. You, now, must place the greatest name, the  legacy of the knowledge and the symbols of knowledge of prophet-hood with Ali (a.s.). It is  because I do not want to live the earth without having a scholar theirin so that people would  learn from him how to obey Me and know through him My guardianship and aauthority. The  scholar would be the Divine authority for those who come to be born at a time between the  passing away of aone prophet to the appearance of the next prophet. The Imam (a.s.) said,  \"He (Muhammad (s.a.) bequeathed to him the greatest name, the legacy of the knowledge and  the symbols of knowledge of the prophet-hood. He also bequeathed to him a thousand word  and a thousand chapter whereby there would open a thousnd chapter and a thousand word  from each chapter and each word.\"",

O people, every man, in his running away,   comes face to face with what he runs away from. The appointed time (to die) is the driver of the soul to it (the time of death). Running away from death is rushing to find it. How many  days have come and gone in which I search for the secret of this matter, however, Allah  disdains to do otherwise, but to keep it secret. It certainly is beyond comprehension; it is a  hidden knowledge.\"My directive will to you is that you must not consider any thing like Allah, Great is Whose praise. You must not disregard the Sunnah (traditions) of Prophet Muhammad (s.a.). Keep  these two pillars straight and light these two beacons. You will not face any blames until you  do not disperse ( remain united). Every man is held responsible for what assiduously gains.  Ignorant, (the lay) people’s burden has been reduced. The Lord is Merciful, the Imam is  knowledgeable and religion is a constructive system. Yesterday I was your companion, today  (I am) a lesson for you and tomorrow I will depart you.

However, if the foot would waver it is because we live  under the shadows of the branches, in the blowing winds, under the shadow of dissipating  clouds in the air and disappearing traces on the land. I was your neighbor that lived along you  with my body for a number of days. You will soon follow my dead body (to the grave).

Tomorrow you see my days and Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, will reveal my  secrets and you will know me better when will not find me in my place and the holding of  others my position. If I will survive I will be the authority for my own-self but if I will die  then death is my destination. If I will forgive (my assassin) then forgiveness is a means of  getting closer (to Allah) and for you it is good deed. You must forgive and ignore. Do you not  like that Allah will forgive you? How great is the sorrow for the neglectful ones whose life  will testimony for his own condemnation or lead him his days to misfortune.

Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has added it to the inheritance  from his father and mother. You are the choosen ones from His creatures.

Certainly there is a great  deal of facts in my head (about your excellence and virtues) that even with buckets can not be  drained and by the songs of the winds can not be changee. It is like an encyclopedia with  decorated pages. I ready myself to speak them out but I find others have preceded me like the  preceding of a heavenly book or what the messengers have have brought.

Al-Husayn (a.s.) is the most knowledgeable among us and his forebearance is the greatest  among us in gravity. He is the closest to the Messenger of Allah among us in his relationship.  He was a Faqih before he was created. He has read the messages of the Divine revelation  before he would speak. Had Allah known any good in anyone He would not have choosen  Muhammad (s.a.).

Abu al-Hakam has said that ‘Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Ammara  al-Jarmi narrated to me fromYazid ibn Salit.who has said the following. \"Once I met abu  Ibrahim (a.s.) on our way to al-‘Amrah, and I said, \"‘May Allah take my soul in service for  your cause, is the matter with which we deal established?\" He said, \"Yes, but are you  established firmly?\" I said, \"Yes, I and my father met you at this place with abu ‘Abdallah (a. s.) with his brothers present. My father said to him, \"‘May Allah take my soul and the souls of  my parents in service for your cause, you all of you are purified Imams. However, no one  immune from death. Say to me few things that I may say to my predecessors so that they may  not go astray.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Yes, O abu ‘Abdallah, these are my sons and this one is  their master. He pointed to you. He has been taught laws, understanding, generosity and the  knowledge of what people need, and how to settle their disputes in the matters of religion and  the worldly matters. In him there are good moral qualities and good answers. He is a gate of  the gates of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, and in him there is another quality that is  better than all of these.\" My father asked, \"What that quality is, may Allah take my soul and  the souls of my parents in service for your cause?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Allah, the Most  Holy, the Most High, will bring about from him the savior of this ’Umma and her blossom,  her knowledge and her excellence and her wisdom. He will be the best new born and the best  flourishing. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, will spare through him lives, bring peace  among the hostile parties, harmonize the divisiveness, fill up the gap of differences, clothe the  naked, feed the hungry and give protection to the frightened. Through him Allah will send  down rain and mercy to the servant (of His). He will be the best as an aged man and the best  of the flourishing ones. His words are rules and his silence is knowledge. He clarifies for  people their differences and he will administer his relative (associates) before his age of  puberty.\" My father asked, \"May Allah take my soul and the souls of my parents in service  for your cause, is he yet born?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Yes, he is born and several years have  passed.\" Yazid has said, \"At this point a person came with whose could speak.\"Yazid has said, \"I then said to abu Ibrahim (a.s.), ‘Inform me just as your father informed you.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Yes, I can do so. My father lived in a time that was not like this  time.\" I said , \" Whoever would agree with what you said may Allah’s condemnation be up on  him.\" He (Yazid) has said, \"The Imam (a.s.) laughed quite intensely.\" Then he said, \"O abu  ‘Umara, I can inform you that when I came out of my house, I gave my will to my son, so and  so and in public. I allowed my other sons to take part in my instructions with him but I gave  my directive will to him in private and wanted him to be alone. Had it been up myself I would  have placed my directive will with my son al-Qasim because of my love for him and  sympathy. However, it is up to Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, who places it   ((Leadership with Divine Authority) wherever He wants. The Holy Prophet (s.a.) has brought me this information. He showed him to me as well as his the people of who would be with  him. Such it is with us. No one of us places his directive will to any one until the Messenger  of Allah brings its news and so would my great, great, great, great grandfather Ali (a.s.). With  the Messenger of Allah I saw a ring, a sword, a staff, a book and a turban. I asked, \"What is it,  O the Messenger of Allah ?\" He replied, \"The turban is the authority of Allah, the Most Holy,  the Most High,. The sword is the majesty of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High,. The book  is the light of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High. The staff is the power of Allah, the Most  Holy, the Most High. The ring consists all of the above matters.\" Then he said to me, \"The  task has left you for one other than you.\" I then asked, \"O the Messenger of Allah, show me  which of them is he?\" The Messenger of Allah said, \" I have not seen any of the Imams more  impatient for the departure of this task from them more you are. Had Imamat been based on  love, Isma‘il had been more beloved to your father than you were. However, that is from  Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High.\" Then abu Ibrahim said, \"I saw all of my sons, the  living and the dead. Amir al-Mu’minin (a.s.) said to me, \"This one is their master, and he  pointed to my son Ali, thus, he is from and I am from him and Allah is with the people of  good deeds.\"Yazid has said, \"Then abu Ibrahim said, \"O Yazid, this a trust with you. Do not inform about it anyone other than a person of reason or a servant (of Allah) who you know is truthful.  Would you be asked to testify to it you must do so as Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High,  has said, \"God commands you to return that which had been entrusted to you to the rightful  owners.. . .\" (4:58) He also has said, \"Who is more unjust than one who refuses to testify to  the truth that God has given to him?. . .\"(2:140) He has said that abu Ibrahim then said, \" I  then went close to the Messenger of Allah and asked, ‘May Allah take my soul and the souls  of my parents in service for your cause, you have mentioned them in a polural form. Which  one of them is them is he (the Imam)?\" The Messenger of Allah said, \"It is he who sees with  the light of Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, hears with His undesrstanding and speaks  with His wisdom. He finds the truth without making mistakes, he knows ,thusm, he is not  ignorant. He is taught the rules and knowledge. He is this, and he held the hand of my son ,  Ali. Then he said, \"How little is (the time) you will be with him! When you will return from  your journey (of Makka) prepare your directive will, organizes your affairs and complete  whatever you intended to complete. You are about to move away from them to become the  neighbors of people other than them. When you will make such a dicision call Ali to give a  bath, shroud you because it will cleanse you and any thing otherwise will not be acceptable.  This is a well established tradition of the past. Thereafter lie back before him and line up his  brothers and uncles behind him and then command him to say Allahu Akbar (Allah is the  Most Great) nine times over you. This estblishes his position as the executor of your will and  as your guardian when you still are alive. Then call all of your sons after them to bear the  testimony and ask Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, to bear testimony aand Allah is a  sufficient witness.\" Yazid has said that abu Ibrahim (a.s.) then said to me, \"In this year I will  be take (to the next life) and the task (of Leadership with Divine Authority) will blong to my  son Ali synonymous with Ali aand Ali. The first Ali is Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) and the othe   Ali is Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.). He has received the and intelligence like the first Ali a forebearance like him, a victory like him and sufferings like his suuferings. He also received a  suffering like the other Ali, a patience like him against diappointments and he must not speak  soon after the death of Harun at least for four years.\"\"The the Imam (a.s.) said, \"O Yazid, when ever you will pass through this place and meet and you will soon meet himgive him the glad news of the birth of trust worthy son to him, a  protected and holy one. He will inform you of your meeting with me. You then inform him  that the girl from whom this boy will be born is a girl from the family of Mary (Maria), the  maiden girl of the Messenger of Allah, mother of Ibrahim. If will be able to convey my  greetings to her you may do so.\" Yazid has said, \"After the death of abu Ibrahim I met Ali (al- Rida) (a.s.) and he began to speak to me.\" He said, \"O Yazid, \"What do you say about  performing ‘Umra (visit to Makka out of Hajj season)?\" I said, \"May Allah take my soul and  the souls of my parents in service for your cause, it is up to you. I do not have the means to  journey.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Glory belongs to Allah, We would not have asked you  without first taking the rsponsibility for your exoenses.\" We then left for ‘Umra until we  reached that place. The Imam (a.s.) began to speak and he said, \"This is the place wherein you  would meet your neighbors and uncles very often.\" I said, \"Yes, it is true and then I related to  him the story.\" He then said to me, \"The girl has not come as yet. When she will come I will  convey his greetings to her.\" Then we left for Makka and he bought her that year. Shortly  afterwards she give borth to the that boy.\" Yazid has said, \"Brothers of Ali (al-Rida) wanted  to have a part in the leadership and they became my enemies for no good reason.

"Content": "Ahmad ibn Mihran has narrated from Muhammad ibn Ali from abu al-Hakam who has said that ‘Abdallah ibn Ibrahim al-Ja‘fari and ‘Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Umara from Yazid  ibn Salit who has said the following.\"When abu Ibrahim prepared his directive will he called the following people to bear testimony. They were Ibrahim ibn Muhammad (ibn Ali ibn ‘Abdallah ibn Ja‘far ibn abu  Talib) al-Ja'fari, (his brother) Ishaq ibn Muhammad al-Ja‘fari, Ishaq ibn Ja‘far ibn  Muhammad (the brother of al-Imam Musa (a.s.), Ja‘far ibn Salih (ibn Mu‘awiya ibn  ‘Abdallah ibn Ja‘far ibn abu Talib), (his brother) Mu’awiya al-Ja‘fari, Yahya ibn al-Husayn  ibn Zayd ibn Ali (Zayn al-‘Abidin (a.s.), Sa‘d ibn ‘Imran al-Ansari, Muhammad ibn al-Harith  al-Ansari, Yazid ibn Salit. al-Ansari, and Muhammad ibn Ja‘far ibn Sa‘d al-Aslami.Sa‘d al-Aslami recorded the text of the first directive will. \" I ask them to witness and bear testimony that he testifies that there is no Lord except Allah Who is the only Lord Who has  no partner and that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger. The coming of the Hour   (of judgment ) after death is true. The warning is true and that all people will be held responsible for their actions is true. The decree is true and the standing of people before Allah  for judgment is true. All (guidance) that Prophet Muhammad has brought is true. All that the  (great) trust worthy spirit has descended with is true. With it (such beliefs) I live, up on such  beliefs I die and with such beliefs, I will be resurrected if Allah would so will. I ask them  (witnesses) to bear testimony to the fact that this is my directive will with my own hand  writing. I have copied the directive will of my great, great, great, great, great grandfather  Amir al-Mu’minin Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) and the directive will of Muhammad ibn Ali before  it I had copied word for word, and the directive will of Ja‘far ibn Muhammad (a.s.) similarly.  I have directed my will to my son Ali and my sons afterwards with him if he would so will,  find understanding in them and like to confirm them for the task. It will all be up to him.  However, if would dislike them and wanted to remove them it will also be up to his discretion  and there is no say for them against him. I have said in my will that all my charities,  properties, my Mawali (slaves), my children that I leave behind and my sons are for him and  Ibrahim, al-‘Abbass, Qasim, Isma‘il. Ahmad and mother of Ahmad and up to Ali is the affairs  of my ladies not up to them. One third of the charities of my father and two thirds of my  charities will be at his (Ali’s) disposal to deal with as he may deem proper just as an owner  place in them whatever he may like. He may, if he would so decide, sell, gift, grant or give as  charity to those I have specified or others it will all be up to him. He is just as myself in my  will, property, my family and my children. He may confirm his brothers whom I have  specified in this my document he may do so. However, if he would dislike he can remove  them from the task without being any offense or unacceptability on his part. If will find any  changes in their attitude which would be other than those in which I left them and he would  want to return them as in charge of a certain task it will up to him to do so. If any one of them  would want to give in marriage to someone his sister he may not do so without his permission  because he is the most knowledgeable one in the matters of the marriage of his people, his  relatives. If any authority or other individuals from the people would refuse him a thing or  create an obstacle for him in the matters I have mentioned in this my document of will or in  the matters of any of the people I have mentioned in it then such person will become far away  from Allah, His Messenger and the later ones will become far away from him. Such a person  will be subject to condemnation and anger of Allah, those who (have the right to) condemn,  the angels close to Allah, the prophets, the messengers and all the believers. The mothers of  my children will be maintained just as they were in my life time provided they observe Hijab  (Islamic way of dressing) if he would consider it proper. If any of them would go out to her  husbands then she will have no right to return to my place except if Ali would decide  otherwise. The same conditions would apply to my daughters. No one of the brothers, real or  half will have the right to give any of my daughters in marriage. Also no authority or uncle  will any such right without his (Ali’s) approval and agreement. If they would do otherwise,  they have opposed Allah and His Messenger and they rebelled against Him in His own  dominion. He knows best about the marriage of his people, his relatives. If will decide to give  in marriage he may do so and if will decide to refuse he may refuse. I have recommended my  daughters with a likewise recommendations as I have recorded in this my document of  directive will. I have appointed Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, as the witness to bear   testimony to this fact (about my daughters). He and the mother of Ahmad are two witnesses to bear testimony to this fact. No one has the right to open the document of my will or publicize  it when it would be different from what I have said and specified. Whoever would do evil it  would be against his own self and whoever would do good it would for his own good. Your  Lord is not unjust to any one. May send blessings up on Muhammad and his family. Be it an  authority or individuals, must not open or tear this document of my will which I have signed  herein below. Whoever would do so will be subject to the condemnation and anger of Allah  and those who condemn of the angels close to Allah, all the messengers of Allah, all the  believers and Muslims. This would apply to those who would open forcefully this document  of my will. Written and seal by abu Ibrahim. May Allah send His blessings up on Muhammad  and his family.\"Abu al-Hakam has said that abu ‘Abdallah ibn Adam al-Ja‘fari narrated to me from Yazid ibn Salit the following. \"Abu ‘Imran al-Talhi was a judge in Madina. When Musa (a.s.) His  brothers summoned him before the judge, Abu ‘Imran al-Talhi. Al-‘Abbass ibn Musa said,  \"May Allah keep you well and allow people to benefit from you. At the bottom of this  document there is (mentioned) treasures and pearls and he wants to hide and keep them for  himself without us.My father, may Allah grant him blessings, have left nothing that is free  from being referred to him. He has left us all poor. Had I not controlled my self I would told  you something in public. At such time Ibrahim ibn Muhammad rushed towards him saying,  \"Will you speak up about a thing that no one of us will accept it or believe you? You will then  be blamed and defeated among us. We know that you have been lying when still young and  when you grew up. Your father knew you very well. If there was any thing good in you even  though he knew you inside and outside. He would trust you even with two pieces of date.\" At  this time Ishaq ibn Ja‘far, his uncle rushed towards him and grabbed both sides of his collar  saying, \":You are a fool and feeble minded. Pick up this all and what you did the day before  and all others also helped him.\" Abu ‘Imran, the judge then said to Ali (a.s.), \"Stand up O abu  al-Hassan (a.s.). The condemnation of your father is enough for me today. He has certainly  given you a wide range of authority. By Allah, no one knows a person better than his father  does. By Allah, abu ‘Abdallah to us was not a light minded person or weak in his opinions.\"  Al-‘Abbass then said to the judge, \"Open the document and read what is below therein. \" Abu  ‘Imran said, \"I will not open it. The condemnation of your father is enough for me today.\"  Al-‘Abbass said, \"I will tear it down.\" He said, \"That is up to you.\" Al-‘Abbass then removed  the seal and therein they found themselves all removed from their being executors of the will  and the confirmation of Ali as the sole executor of the will. They found out therein the  appointment of Ali as their guardian (with Divine authority) whether they would like or  dislike it. They also found out therein that they were all removed from the list of the  recipients of charities and other benefits. Opening the document turned to become a  misfortune, disgrace and humiliation to them. It proved very good for Ali (a.s.). In the  directive will that al-‘Abbass removed its seal the following names were the signatories.Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, Ishaq ibn Ja‘far, Ja'far ibn Salih and Sa‘id (Sa'd) ibn ‘Imran were the ones who uncovered the face of the mother of Ahmad (who was brought) in the presence   the judge, qadi, excusing that it was not mother of Ahmad, until they had uncovered her face and recognized. She where up on said, \"By Allah, my master (husband) said, \"You will be  coerced to go before a judge.\" Ishaq ibn Ja‘far admonished her saying,, \"Be quite, women  suffer from weakness. I do not think he has said any such thing.\" Ali (a.s.) then turned to  al-‘Abbass and said, \"My brother, I understand that debts and liabilities up on you have  forced you to this. O Sa‘id come with me so we can help them pay for them. By Allah, I will  ignore to help you and cooperate with you as long as will walk on earth. You may say  whatever you like.\" Al-‘Abbass then said, \"You are not giving us anything other than the  extra of our own properties which are with you. In fact, our properties with are more than.\"  He (The Imam (a.s.) said, say whatever you want. Honor is your own honor. If you do good it  will for your own selves before Allah and if you do evil Allah is forgiving. By Allah, you  know, that today I have no son and heir other than you. If I will keep anything think I might  away from you or store it in hiding it will be for you and will return to you. By Allah, from  the day your father, may Allah be pleased with him, left this world I have not owned anything  but that I have disposed of it as have seen.\" Al-‘Abbass moved forwards and said, \"By Allah,  it is not so. Allah has not imposed any of your opinions on us. Only our father was jealous  against us. His decisions are not justifiable before Allah and nor is your decisions. You know  that I know Safwan ibn Yahya who sells al-Sabiry (fine fabrics) in Kufa. If you admit I can  make it very difficult for both of you to swallow your Saliva.\" Ali (a.s.) then said, \"There is  no means and no power except with Allah, the Most Holy, the Most Great. My brothers I am  very keen to see you happy. Allah knows it. O Lord, if you know that I love to see them  prosper, do good to them, maintain good relations with them, show kindness to them then  help me day and night and reward me for my efforts. Otherwise, you are the One who know  the hidden facts, then reward me for what i deserve, good for good and evil for evil. O Lord,  grant them well being and grant well being through them. Make Stan to despair about us.  Help them to obey you and grant them the opportunity to learn your guidance. My brothers, I  wish and work to make you happy and strive for your well being. Allah guards whatever we  say.\" Al-‘Abbass then said, \"I know your language very well. Your shovel can not find any  soil with me to pick up.\" The people dispersed at this point. May Allah send blessing up on  Muhammad and his family.",

You must know that if one of you would perform his obligatory prayer in congregation   maintaining secrecy from the enemy, in time and complete it, Allah will record it as equal to fifty obligatory prayers performed in congregation. If one of you would perform an obligatory  prayer individually maintaining secrecy from the enemy, in time and complete it Allah,  Majestic is Whose mention, will record it as equal in virtue to twenty five obligatory prayers  performed individually. If one of you would perform an optional prayer in time and complete  it, Allah will record it as equal to ten optional prayers. If one of you would do one good deed,  Allah, Majestic is Whose mention, will record it as equal to twenty good deeds. Allah,  Majestic is Whose mention, will grant multiple rewards for the good deeds of a believer  among you when he would make his deeds good. Allah will grant him good reward in  multiples for maintaining secrecy in his religion, about his Imam (a.s.) and his own life and  would control his tongue. Allah, Majestic is Whose mention, is generous.\"I then said, \"May Allah take my soul in service for your cause, you have certainly given me courage to do good deeds and have given me much exhortation. However, I love to know how  would we today be of more virtuous deeds than the followers of the Imam (a.s.) from you  who would be among them in public sight under the government of the truth while we all  have the same religion?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"You have become the winner in this in  accepting the religion of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, in prayer, in fasting, in  performing Hajj in every good deed, in understanding and in the worship of Allah, Majestic is  Whose mention, in secrecy. (You have maintained) secrecy from your enemies when your  Imam does not live in public sight, but you obey him in patience on his side, waiting and  expecting the establishment of the government of truth while you are afraid for your Imam  and your own lives from the unjust kings. You wait for and expect to receive your rights and  the right of your Imam that are usurped by unjust ones. They have denied your rights and  have forced you towards the worldly gains and means of living with patience in performing  your religious duties, your worship, your obedience to your Imam and fear from your  enemies. For this reason Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, will grant you the  reward for your good deeds in multiples. May it be handsome and graceful for you.\"I then said, ‘May Allah take my soul in service for your cause, what would your holiness say in the following cases? Would our deeds as the companions of the al-Qa’im (the one to  establish the kingdom of Allah), when the truth would become dominant, be more virtuous or  now that we are your followers and obeying you? Would our deeds be more virtuous now or those during the dominance of the government of the truth and justice?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Glory belongs to Allah. Do you not love to to see Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, grant dominance to the truth and justice in all lands, unit ideologies, bring together the differing  hearts so no one would disobey Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, on His earth?  (Do you not love to see) His laws are practiced among His creatures and Allah would make the rights to return where they belong and over come so nothing of the truth would be kept secret for fear of any of the creatures?

Yusuf was the in charge of Egypt and there was a  distance of twenty eight days of journey between him and his father. If he wanted to inform  him (his father) he could have done so. Jacob and his sons journeyed after they heard the  good new for nine days from their Bedouin home to Egypt. Why then this nation would refuse  to accept if Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most Gracious, would do to the person who possess  His authority what He did to Yusuf? That he would walk in their market place and step on  their furnishings until Allah will grant him permission to reappear in public as He did to  Yusuf as they said, \"Are you really Yusuf?\" He said, \"Yes, Yusuf I am .\"",

A chubby, tall and heavy man then  came in and greeted the Imam with the greeting for Wilaya, the Leader with Divine Authority  and received the acceptance response. The Imam (a.s.) asked him to have a sit and he sat just  next to me.

He has brought it with  him and wants me to print my seal on it also. He then asked the man to give it to him. The  man took out a pebble and on one side of there was a smooth space. Abu Muhammad (a.s.)  then took it, brought his seal out, printed on it and the print took place. Even now it is as if I  see the print of his (al-Hassan ibn Ali’s) seal on the pebble it. I then said to the man from  Yemen, \"Had you ever seen him (abu Muhammad (a.s.) before?\" He said, \"No, by Allah, I  had always was anxious to see him until at this time a young man came to me whom I had not  seen before and said, ‘Stand up and come in and I came in.\" The man from Yemen then left  saying, \"May Allah’s grace and blessings be with you people of Ahl al-Bayt whose each  generation is just the other generation.

In the meeting he said, \"O son of my brother, you know that the  Messenger of Allah (s.a) delivered the task of al-Wasiyya, (the executor-ship of the will) and  al-Imamat, (Leadership with Divine Authority) thereafter it was delivered to al-Hassan (a.s.)  and then to al-Husayn (a.s.). Your father, may Allah be pleased with him has been murdered,  may Allah grant blessing up on his soul, and he did make any will. I am your uncle and equal  in status to your father and I am a son of Ali (a.s.). Because of being older in age I am more  deserving of the the position of Imamat considering that you are younger than me. Therefore,  you should not dispute with me about al-Wasiyya, the will and Imamat, leadership and should  argue with me about it.\" Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.) said, \"O uncle, be pious before Allah and do  not claim in what you have no right. I advise not to be of the ignorant people. In fact, my  father (a.s.), O my uncle, appointed me as the executor of his will before his leaving for Iraq.  He made such covenant with me just an hour before his becoming a martyr. This is the  Armament of the Messenger of Allah with me. You then should not dislocate them. I am  afraid for you of a shorter life and quandary of conditions. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most  gracious, has placed al-Wasiyya, and Imamat in the descendants of al-Husayn (a.s.). If you  would like to know it we can go near the Blackstone and fro judgment and ask it about the  issue.\" Abu Ja'far (a.s.) has said that the issue came up between them in Makka and they went  near the Blackstone. Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.) said to Muhammad al-Hanafiya, \"You begin first  and pray to Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, and ask Him to make the Blackstone  speak to you and then ask your question.\" Muhammad then pleaded in his prayer and asked  Allah and then ask the Blackstone about the disputed issue but there was no answer. Ali ibn al- Husayn (a.s.) said, \"O uncle, had you been the Executor of the will and the Imam it would  have answered your question. Muhammad then said, \"Now you pray to Allah, O son of my  brother and ask your question. Alin ibn al-Husayn (a.s.) prayed to Allah for what he wanted  then addressing the Blackstone said, \"I ask you for the sake of the One Who placed the  covenant of the prophets in you, as well as the covenant of the executors of the will and the  covenant of all the peole. You must tell us who the Wasiyy and Imam after al-Husayn (a.s.)?\"  The narrator has said that the Blackstone began to shake so much that it almost camme out of  its place. Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, then made it to speak in clear Arabic  language and said, \"O Lord, al-Wasiyya and Imamat after al-Husayn (a.s.) ibn Ali is for Ali  ibn al-Husayn ibn Ali aibn abu Talib and ibn Fatima (a.s.) daughter of the the Messenger of  Allah.\" The narrator has said that Muhammad Ali (a.s.) returned back and he acknowledged  Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.) to be his Wali (Leadership with Divine Authority).\"  Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from his father from Hammad ibn ‘Isa from Hariz from Zurara from abu Ja'far (a.s.) the same hadith.",

A man came out of the house that I thought was his slave. I said to him, \"Ask your master to  grant me permission to see him.\" He went inside and then came out saying come in.\" I entered  the house and found an old man devoted to worship and hard work. I greeted him and then he  asked, \"Who are you?\"I then said, \"I am a Kalbi (from the tribe of Kalb) and a genealogist.\"  He then asked, \"What is it that you need?\" I said, \"I have come to ask certain questions.\" He  then asked, \"Have you visited my son Muhammad?\" I said, \"I have began with you.\" Then he  said, \"you may ask your questions.\" I then said, \"Explain to me the case of a man who says to  his wife, \"You are divorced as many times as the number of stars in heavens.\" He said, \"It  becomes irrevokeable at the beginning of the month of Jawza’ (the third moth of a particular  calendar).

I greeted them and said to them, \" Who knows this Ahl al-Bayt (family)?\"  They said, \"‘Abdallah ibn al-Hassan knows.\" I then said, \"I just visited him and did not find  anything with him.\" One person from the people raised his head and said, \"Go to Ja'far ibn  Muhammad (a.s.). He is the most knowledgeable one in this Ahl al-Bayt (family).\" Certain  individuals blamed that person for what he said.

He is  the one I want.\" I then walked until I reached his house. I knocked the door and his slave  came out and asked me, \"Come in O brother from the tribe of Kalb.\" He, by Allah, amazed  me. I went inside but I was shaken. Up on looking I found a gentleman on the prayer rug with  no pillow or blankets. He began to talk after I saluted him, \"Who are you?\" I then said to  myself, \"Glory to Allah, \"His slave at the door said to me, \"O brother from the tribe of Kalb,  come in and his master asks me, \"Who are you?\" I then said, \"I am a Kalbi, a genealogist.\" He   then tapped his forehead and said, \"The devious people lie about Allah and they go stray faraway and suffer a great loss.

People had gathered around ‘Abdallah ibn Ja'far thinking that  he was the in charge of this task (Leadership with Divine Authority) after his father. I and  Sahib al-Taq went to see him while people were around him because of a hadith that they  would narrate from abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) that said, \"The in charge of the task (Leadership with  Divine Authority) will the eldest son if he would not suffer any defects. We went to see and  ask him what we used to ask his father. We asked him about Zakat to find out on how much  property it becomes due. He said, \"It becomes as five on every two hundred.\" We askked,  \"What if it would one hundred?\" He said, \"It will be two and a half.\" We then said, \"By Allah,  al-Murji‘a sect does not say so.\" The narrator has said that he raised his hands to the sky and  said, \"By Allah, I do not know what the al-Murji‘a group says.\" The narrator has said that we  then left his with a feeling of loss and did not know where to go. I and abu Ja'far al-Ahwal  were together. We sat down on an street corner of the city of Madina weeping and confused  and did not know where and to who should we go saying to each other, \"Where would go  now. Should we go al-Murji‘, al-Qadria, (belief in predestination), to al-Zaydiaya sect, al- Mu‘tazila or the al-Khawarij sect?\" at this time I saw a gentleman who I did not know,  gesture towards me with his hand. I became afraid and though he might be a spy of the spies  of abu Ja'far al-Mansur. He had his spies in Madina to see who the Shi‘a would follow abu  ‘Abdallah (a.s.) and then they would cut his neck off. I was afraid thinking that he might be  one of them. I then said to al-Ahwal, \"Get away from here because I am afraid for both of us.  He only waants me and not you. Move away from mme not to get destroyed and become an  instrument against yourself. He moved a little away and I followed the gentleman. I did so  thinking that will not beable to set myself free form him. I continued following him. I had  become certain of dying until we reached the door of abu al-Hassan (a.s.). He then left me  there and went away. At that time the servant came out of the house and said, \"Come inside,  may Allah grant you blessings.\" I went in and found abu al-Hassan (a.s.) therein. He begun  talking to me, \"Not to al-Murji‘a, or al-Qadria, or al-Zaydiya nor to al-Mu‘tazila or al-Khariji  group, but come to me, come to me.\" I then said, \"May Allah take my soul in service for your  cause, has your father left this world?\" He said, \"Yes, he has passed away. I then asked, \" Did  he die a natural death?\" He said, \"Yes, he did so.\" I then ask, \"Who will be for us after him?\"  He said, \"If Allah would will to guide you he will do so.\" I then said, \"May Allah take my  soul in service for your cause, ‘Abdallah thinks that he is the one after his father.\" He said,  \"‘Abdallah wants that Allah not be worshipped.\" I then said, May Allah take my soul in   service for your cause, who will be for us after him?\" He said, \"If Allah would will to guide you he will do so.\" I then said, \"May Allah take my soul in service for your cause, is that  you?\" He said, \"No, I do not say that to you.\" He has said that I then said to myself, \"Perhaps  I could not ask in the right way.\" Then I said, \"May Allah take my soul in service for your  cause, is there any Imam above you?\" He said, \"No, there is no Imam above me.\" He has said  that then something struck my mind in away that no one would know except Allah, the Most  Majestic, the Most gracious. It was a feeling of his greatness and awe greater then what I  would feel in the presence of his father. Then I said, \"May Allah take my soul in service for  your cause, may I ask what I used to ask your father?\" He said, \"Ask, you will have the  answers but do not make them public. If you would do so it will be slaughtering.\" I asked him  and found him to be like an ocean of knowledge there does not dry up. I then said, \"May  Allah take my soul in service for your cause, your Shi‘a, followers and the followers of your  father are in loss and false guidance. Thus, can I meet them and call them to you? I will keep  it secret.\" He said, \"If you will find intelligent people inform them but make him to promise  secrecy. If they would make it public it will be slaughter, he pointed with his hand to his  throat. He has said that I than left him and met abu Ja'far al-Ahwal. He asked me, \"What is  behind you.\" I said, \"It is guidance.\" I then informed him of the whole story. We then met al- Fudayl and abu Basir. They both went to see him, heard his words, asked him and became  certain of his Imamat (Leadership with Divine Authority). Thereafter we met people in  groups. Whoever would go and see him he would become certain of his Imamat (Leadership  with Divine Authority) except the tribe of ‘Ammar and his companions. ‘Abdallah was left  alone and no one would go to see him except a very few people. When he found out about the  conditions he said, \"What is the matter with the people?\" They told him (‘Abdallah) that  Hisham has prevented people from visiting you.\" Hisham has said that he(‘Abdallah) made  many people to ambush and beat me up\"",

I then stretched it  before him and he said a prayer. When I left little later on my leg began to feel the pain in a  vein but it was very little.\"",

"Content": "Ali ibn Muhammad has narrated from one of our people whose name he mentioned. He said that Muhammad ibn Ibrahim narrated to us, that Musa ibn Muhammad ibn ’Isma‘il ibn  ‘Ubaydallah ibn ‘Abbass ibn Ali ibn abu Talib narrated to us from Ja'far ibn Zayd ibn Musa  from his father, from his forefathers the following. \"One day ’Umm Aslam came to the Holy  Prophet (s.a) when he was in the house of ’Umm salama. She asked about the Messenger of   Allah. ’Umm Salama relied that he had just went out for some thing and that he would return  soon. She then waited with ’Umm Salama until he (the Messenger of Allah) came. ’Umm Aslam then said, \"May Allah take my soul and the souls of my parents in service for your  cause, Messenger of Allah, I have read the books and have learned about all the prophets and  the executors of the their will. Moses had an executor for his will even in his life time and an  executor of the will after he died. So also was Jesus. Who then is the executor of your will, O  the Messenger of Allah?\" He then said to her, \"O ’Umm Aslam, the executor of my will in  my lifetime and after I will is the same person.\" Then he said to her, \"O ’Umm Aslam,  \"Whoever would be able to do what I intend to do just now he is and will be the executor of  my will.\" He then picked up a pebble from the floor and crushed it with his fingers into  something like flour. He then turned it into a piece of clay and then printed his seal on it and  said, \"Whoever would be able to do what I just did he will be theexecutor of my will in my  lifetime and after I will die.\" She then left him. She has said that she went to Amir al- Mu’minin Ali (a.s.) and said, \"May Allah take my soul and the souls of my parents in service  for your cause, are you the executor orf the will of the Messenger of Allah?\" He said, \"Yes, I  am, O ’Umm Aslam.\" He then picked up a pebble, crushed it into powder like flour, turned it  into clay and printed his seal on it. He then said, \"O ’Umm Aslam, whoever would be able to  do what I just did he will be the executor of my will.\" I them went to al-Hassan (a.s.) while he  was a young boy. I asked him, \"My master, are you the executor of the will of yourfather?\"  He said, \"Yes, I am, O ’Umm Aslam.\" He picked up a pebble and did exactly what his father  had done. I left him and went ot al-Husayn (a.s.) and considered him very little because of his  young age. I asked him, \"Are you the executor of the will of your brother?\" He saaid, \"Yes, I  am. O ’Umm Aslam bring me a pebble.\" He then did exactly what they had done.She has said that she lived until she met Ali ibn al-Husayn (a.s.) after the martyrdom of his father, on his return from Iraq. I asked him, \"Are you the executor of the will of your father?\"  He said, \"Yes, I am. He then also did exactly what they (a.s.) had done.\"",

"Content": "Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Ahmad ibn Muhammad from al-Husayn ibn Sa‘id from al-Husayn ibn al-Jarud from Musa ibn Bakr ibn Dab from the one who narrated to him  from abu Ja'far (a.s.) who has said the following. \"Once Zayd ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn went to  see abu Ja'far, Muhammad ibn Ali. He carried with him letters from the people of Kufa who  invited him to their (city) and informed him of their coming together and asking him to rise.  Abu Ja'far (a.s.) then asked him, \"Are these letters their initiative or as response to what you  had written to them and ask them to do?\" He said that it was their initiative because they  acknowledge our rights and because of our being from the family of the Messenger of Allah.  It is also because of what they read in the book of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most  gracious, about the obligation to love us and must obey us. Also it is because of the suffering,  impediments and afflictions that we had been through.\" Abu Ja'far (a.s.) said to him, \" Obedience is an obligation from Allah, the Most Majestic, the   Most gracious. It is a tradition Sunna that He had established in the people of the past and in the same way it will continue in the later generations of the people. Obedience is only for one  of us and to love is for all of us. The command of Allah applies to His friends because of the  rules already made available and because of the decision already made distinct, because of the  finalized decision and of the measurement that has already taken place and because of the  appointed time on a certain date. Do not be hasty because Allah does not become hasty  because hastiness in the people. Do not try to surpass Allah because in your doing so  misfortune will defeat and destroy you.\" The narrator has said that Zayd became angry and  said, \"The Imam from us is not the one who would sit in his home, draw the curtain around  him and lag from struggle (jihad). The Imam from us is the one who safeguards his dominion,  fights for the cause of Allah a real fight, defends those who hold high regards for him and his  rights.\" Abu Ja'far (a.s.) then said, \"O brother, do you really find any of the things that you  mentioned about your self? If so, then can you show a supporting proof from the book of  Allah or and evidence from the Sunna of the Messenger of Allah or give a similar example?  Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, made things lawful and unlawful. He has  sanctioned the obligations, provided examples and has set up traditions Sunan. He has not  made the Imam who would rise with Divine authority on His command engulfed in doubts in  the matters of the obligation to obedience to him. He has not made him as such that he would  act up on an issue before its proper place, struggle for something before it is there yet. Allah,  the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, has said, \" Believers, do not hunt when you are in the  holy precinct. .\" (5:95) Is hunting an animal that has been made prohibited during Hajj more  serious or the killing of a person that Allah has prohibited? Allah, the Most Majestic, the  Most gracious, has assigned a place for everything. \"Once the restrictions of iz r2 m are over,  you may hunt. . .\" (5:2). Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, has said, \"Believers, do  not disrespect the reminders of God, the sacred months,. . .\" (5:2) He has made the number of  months wellknown of which four are sacred ones. He has said, \". . . during the four sacred  months, they (pagans) may travel peacefully through the land. Know (pagans) that you cannot  make God helpless. ..\" (9:2) Then Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, has said,  \"When the sacred months are over, slay the pagans wherever you find them.. .\" (9:5) He has  assigned a place for it. He has also said, \"Do not decide for a marriage before the appointed  time is over.. .\" (2:235) He has assigned a time for everything and for evry period of time  there is a (Kitab) a rule. If you may have the necessary evidence from you Lord, certainty  from your self in your affairs and you know well about it then you may act accordingly.  Otherwise, do not aim at an issue in which you have doubts and uncertainty. Do not act to end  a kingdom the sustanance of which is not yet exhausted, its time has not ended and its (Kitab)  rule has not reached its time. When its timme comes, its sustanance deminish and its rule  reaches its time the gap will be removed and the system will follow and Allah will make the  followers (of falsehood) and those followed to suffer humiliation. O brother, do you want to  revive the wasy of a people who has rejected the signs of Allah, disobeyed His Messenger,  followed their desires, (those have followed their dessires) without guidance from Allah,  claimed the Khilafa (Leadership with Divine Authority) without authority and evidence from  Allah, or a covenant from the Messenger of Allah ? I ask Allah to grant you refuge, from  being crucified tomorroow in al-Kunasa. Then his eyes became flooded with tears that flowed   down and then said, \"Allah is between us and the people who disregarded our honor, ignored our rights, made our secrets public and have ascribed us someone other than our grandfather.  Those who have said about us we oursellves do not say.\".",

"Content": "One of our people has narrated from Muhammad ibn Hassa’n from Muhammad ibn Ranjawayh from ‘Abdallah ibn al-Hakam al-Armani from ‘Abdallah ibn Ibrahim ibn  Muhammad al-Ja'fari who has said the following. \"We went to Khadijah, the daughter of ‘Umar ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.) to offer our condolences for the death of the son of her daughter. We met at her place  Musa ibn ‘Abdallah ibn al-Hassan. She was to one side near the ladies. We offered them our  condolences to all of them. We then turned to him and he said to abu Yashkur’s daughter, the  reader of lamentations, \"Say it.\" She then read the following lines.Evaluate the Messenger of Allah,  Evaluate those after him, the loin of the Lord, (Hamrza) and ‘Abbass as the third of themEvaluate Ali the embodiment of goodness and also evaluate Ja'far Evaluate ‘Aqil after him all leaders. He said, \"Very good, it was very moving. Say more lines.\" She was encouraged and said:From us is the leader of the pious ones, the Holy ProphetAnd the chief of his army that purified Imam (Ali (a.s.)  From us is Ali his son in-law and cousin And from us is Hamza and the well disciplined Ja'far.We stayed with her until it was almost night. Khadija said, \"I heard my uncle Muhammad ibn Ali (a.s.) say that a lady’s reading lines of lamentation is good only if her tear would flow. It  is not proper for her to say meaningless things. When night falls then you should disturb the  angles with your lamentations.We then left her house and went to her next day and discussed with her about moving her residence from the house of abu ‘Abdallah, Ja'far ibn Muhammad. He (Musa) then said, \"This   is called the house of theft.\" She then said, \"This is what our Mahdi has chosen, meaning thereby ‘Abdallah ibn al-Hassan, she would jock with him.\" Musa ibn ‘Abdallah then said,  \"By Allah, I can tell you a very strange matter that I experienced with my father. When my  father, may Allah grant him mercy, became involved in theaffaairs of Muhammad ibn  ‘Abdallah and gathered his companions to meet him he decided to go and he would lean on  me. I went with him until we came to abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.). We met him out side when he  wanted to go to the mosque. My father stopped him and spoke to him. Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.)  said, \"This is not a proper place to talk. We Allah willing will meet again. My returned very  happy. He waited until morning or the next day and then we went to see him. I and my father  met him and he began to speak and among other things he said to him, \"May Allah take my  soul in service for your cause, you know already that I am older than you and that among your  people there are those who are older than you but Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most  gracious, has granted you priority and excellence that is not found in any of your people. I  have come to you, relaying on your virtue and knowing, May Allah take my soul in service  for your cause, that if you would agree with me others will not differ. None of your  companions will disagree with me and no one from the people of Quraysh or others will  dispute me.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) thensaid to him, \"You can certainly find other people more obedient to you than I then you will not need me. You know that I, by Allah, want to move to an empty  land or think about it but I feel heavy in doing so. I want Hajj but I can not attain it without  hard work and exhaustion and hardship for my self. You should find others to support you but  do not say that you have met me.\"He then said, \"The people look up to you. If you would support me no one will disagree with me. You do not have to suffer fighting or hardships.\" The narrator has said that then people  surrounded us aand our talks were discontinued. My father said, \"May Allah take my soul in  service for your cause, what do you say?\" He said, \"You will meet me, Allah willing.\" He  then said, \"Will it be the way I love?\" He said, \"It will, Allah willing, be the way you love in  your favor.\" He came home and sent a messenger to Muhammad in the mountains at Juhayna,  called al-Ashqar two nights journey from Madina. He gave him the glad news and informed  him of his success in the task that he had asked for (support from Ja'far ibn Muhammad (a.s.)  for his uprising).After three day we went again and stood before the door. We would not have been stopped before. The messenger delayed but then gave us permission. We went inside and I sat on one  side of the room. My father went close to him, kissed his head and said, May Allah take my  soul in service for your cause, I have come again with hopes and expectation expanding with  a wish to achieve what I need.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) then said, \"O son of my uncle, I beseech  Allah’s protection for you and ask you not to become involved in this matter (political  uprising). I am afraid for you from evil. The talks continued between them and they ended to  what he did not want. He said, \"For what reason al-Husayn (a.s.) was more deserving than al- Hassan (a.s.) (in leaving Imamat to his descendants)?\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) said, \"May Allah   grant blessings to al-Hassan and al-Husayn (a.s.). How would you mention this?\" He said, \"Were al-Husayn to act with justice, he should have left it (Imamat) to the eldest son of al- Hassan.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) said, \"When Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, sent  revelations to Muhammad (s.a) He did so what He wanted. He did not ask any one else for  consultation. Muhammad commanded Ali for whatever he wanted and he obeyed the order.  We say nothing else in it except what the Messenger of Allah has said in his (al-Husayn’s)  praise and affirmation. Had al-Husayn to transfer it (the will) to the eldest or to the sons of  both of them he would have done so. He is not accused of anything before us such as keeping  for himself. He could have done anything he wanted but he did only what he was commanded  to do. He is your grandfather (from mother’s side) and your uncle. It would have better for to  speak good of him. If you would say meaningless thins about him, then may Allah forgive  you. Son of my unlce, obey me and listen to my words. By Allah, besides Whom there is no  Lord, that I do not refrain from giving you good advise. How is it that you not act  accordingly. There is no escape from the commands of Allah.\" My father became happy at  this point. Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) then said to him, \"By Allah, you know that the oblique eyed  with few hairs on his forehead will be killed at the doorway of al-Ashja‘. Near the the bottom  of the water bed.\" My father said, \"That is not him. By Allah, he will fight them day for day,  hour for an hour and a year for a year. He will revenge for all of the descendants of abu  Talib.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) then said, \"How much I fear of applicability of the this line to him: \"Your soul in private gave you false hopes\" No, by Allah, he will gain more the walls of  Madina and can not reach Taef no matter how hard he may try. What must happen happens.  Be pious before Allah and have mercy on your self and on the sons of your father. By Allah, I  consider him to be the most unfortunate seed that man have ever deposited in the wombs of  women. By Allah, he will be killed at the doorway of al-Asha‘ among their houses. By Allah,  it is as if I see him dropped dead and looted and a brick placed between his legs. Nothing that  is said to him benefits this boy\" Musa ibn ‘Abdallah has said that I was meant by these words.  He will take part in the uprising but will be defeated and his friend will be killed. He the take  will takke part in another uprising under another banner. Their leader will be killed and their  soldiers will disperse. If he will obey me immunity for him could be achieved from the  descendant of ‘Abbass until will grant relief. You already know that matter will not become  successful. You know and we know that your son, the oblique eyed with few hair on his  forehead will be killed at the doorway of al-Ashja‘, near their house in the bottom of the  water bed.\" My father stood up saying, \"In fact, Allah will make us needless of you or you  will change or He will make come back with the others. You only in this way keeping others  from helping us or a reason for it.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) then said, \"Allah knows that I only want to give good advise and guidance and that is all I can try.\" My father then left, with his clothes dragging behind him  due to anger. Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) reached him out and said, \"I heard you uncle who also is  maternal uncle mention that you and the sons of your father will be killed. If you can obey me  and do what is good then do it. By Allah beside Whom there is no Lord, Who knows the   unseen and what is present, the Beneficent the Merciful, The Most Great, the Most High that you are important to me. Nothing is important to me than you. I would loved to sacrifice the  most beloved of my sons and most beloved person in my family to protect you. Do not think  that I have cheated you.\" My father left with anger and regrets. Thereafter we did not wait for  more than twenty nights or so. Then the messengers of abu Ja'far (the Abbasside ruler) came  and arrested my uncles, Sulayman ibn hassan, Hassan ibn Hassan, Ibrahim ibn Hassan,  Dawud ibn Hassan, Ali ibn Hassan, Sulayman ibn Dawud, Hassan, Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn  Hassan, Hassan ibn Ja'far ibn Hassan, Ta ba ta ba Ibrahim ibn ’Isma‘il ibn Hassan and  ‘Abdallah ibn Dawud. They were tied in chains and place on camel backs without covering.  They placed on display in the Musalla area, (open space for congregational prayer) so that  people would condemn them. People did not do so. In fact, they sympathized with them  because of their poor conditions. Then they were released. They stood before the door of the  mosque of the Messenger of Allah.‘Abdallah ibn Ibrahim al-Ja'fari has said that Khadija daughter of ‘Umar ibn Ali said to us, \"When they were made to stand before the door of the mosque called the Gate of Jibril, abu  ‘Abdallah (a.s.) came to them, while his gown dragged behind him in a hurry. He came out of  the door of the mosque saying, \"May Allah condemn you, O people of Madina –three times.  The Holy Prophet did not covenant with you for this nor had you pledged allegiance to for  such thing. By Allah, I was hopeful, but I am defeated and there is no escape from the  decision of Allah. He then left one shoe on his foot and one in his hand with his gown  dragging behind. He went home and suffered from fever for twenty days weeping day and  night and became very afraid for him. This is the narration of Khadija. Al-Ja'fari has said that Musa ibn ‘Abdallah ibn Hassan narrated that when they appeared on the backs of the camels came out of the mosque and bent over ‘Abdallah ibn Hassan to speak  to him. He was harshly stopped and the security man pushed him aside saying, \"Get away  from him. May Allah soon suffice you and others like you.\" They then were taken to the  streets and abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) went home. Before they would reach the grave yard al-Baqi‘,  the security man faced a sever misfortune. His camel hit him at his leg and crushed it and he  died very soon. The people were taken away. After a while Muhammad ibn ‘Abdallah ibn  Hassan came and told that his father and his uncles were killed. Abu Ja'far (Abbasside ruler)  killed them. Only Hassan ibn Ja'far , Ta ba ta ba, Ali ibn Ibrahim, Sulayman ibn Dawud,  Dawud ibn Hassan, and ‘Abdallah ibn Dawud were not killed. At that time Muhammad ibn ‘Abdallah rose and called people for pledge of allegiance to him. The narrator has said that he was one of the three people to pledge allegiance to him. No one  from Quraysh, from Ansar (people of Madina or a Arab opposed him. He consulted ‘Isa ibn  Yazid, a trusted person to him and a commander of his army. He consulted him in the matter  of sending a message to the leaders of his people. ‘Isa ibn Yazid said to him, \"If you would  just call them may not respond. You must become strong and strict with them. Thus, allow me  to handle it for you. Muhammad agreed and said, \"Do what you like.\" He then said, \"Send to  their leader and the greatest among them, namely ‘Abdallah Ja'far ibn Muhammad (a.s.). If   you become strict with him all will learn that they also will experience what he has been through.\" The narrator has said, \"In a very little time they brought abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) and  made him to stand up before him (Muhammad)’Isa ibn Yazid said, \"Submit and you will be  safe.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) then said, \"Have you invented a prophet-hood after Prophet  Muhammad (s.a.)?\" Muhammad then said, \"Pledge allegiance your life, property and children  will be protected and you will not have to fight. Abu ‘Abdallah then said, \"I have nothing to  do with war and fighting. I advised your father and warned him against what went through but  warning does not help what is already measured. Son of my brother, find the young ones and  leave the elderly alone.\" Muhammad said, \"There is not much difference between my and  your age.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) said, \"I am not here to defeat you or compete you in what you  do.\" Muhammad said, \"By Allah, you must pledge allegiance.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) said,  \"Son of my brother, I do not want a war, or gain any worldly thing. I want to go out in the  open land but it is heavy for me. Even my family have asked me several times. Only  weakness holds me back. By Allah, and for the sake of family relations save us from  misfortune from your hands.\" He then said, \"O abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.), by Allah, abu Dawaniq  (Abbasside ruler) has died.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) said, What that has to do with me?\" He said  I wanted honor through you.\" He then said, \"There is no way for you to that. By Allah,  abuDawaniq has not died, except in (your) dreams.\" He said, \"By Allah you must pledge  allegiance to me, voluntarily or by force but then it will and by force your pledge will lose its  value.\" He refused it strongly. He was sent to prison. ‘Isa ibn Yaziid said, \"There is not  enough security in the prison and without tying him up he may run away.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a. s.) laughed and said, \"There is no means and power without Allah, the Most High, the most  Great. Will you imprison me?\" He said, I swear by the One Who honored Muhammad (s.a)  that I will imprison you severely.\" ‘Isa ibn Yazid said, \"Keep him in stable that belong to  Rita.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) then said, \"By Allah will soon say it and I will be confirmed.\" ‘Isa  ibn Yazid said, \"Be quite or I will break your mouth.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) said, \"You blue  eyed and bald say this. I can see you looking for a hole to hide. You are not even worthy to be  mentioned. On meeting (the enemy) even if one would clap his hands behind you, you will  run away like an ostrich. Muhammad ordered ‘Isa ibn Yazid to imprison him and be strict  with him.\"Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) said, \"By Allah as if I see you coming out of the doorway of al-Ashja‘ to the bottom of the water bed in the valley and a marked horse man has attacked with a spear  in his hand, half white and half black, riding a brown horse with a white forehead. He hits you  but it does not kill you. You hit the nose of his horse and it is injured. Another man attacks  you from the alley of Al ‘Ammar al-Diliyinn. He has two band of hair coming out of his  helmet with thick mustache. He, by Allah, is your adversary. May Allah have no mercy on his  bones.\" Muhammad said, \"O abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.), you have calculated but have a mistake. Al- Suraqi ibn al-Salkh came to him and pushed him into the prison. They looted his properties  and the properties of those of his people who did not come out with Muhammad. After this  they brought ’Isma‘il ibn ‘Abdallah ibn Ja'far ibn Abu Talib who was very old and weak. One  of his eys was gone and both of his legs would not work. He had to be carried. He was asked  to pledge allegiance for him. He said, \"Son of my brother, I am an old man and weak. I need   your kindness and support.\" He said, \"You must pledge allegiance.\" He saaid, \"What is the benefit of my pledge of allegiance? By Allah, my name will only waste the space for the  name of a man.\" He said, \"You must do so.\" He used strong language with him. ’Isma‘il then  said, \"Call for me Ja'far ibn Muhammad (a.s.) perhaps we both pledge allegiance for you.\"  The narrator has said that when Ja'far ibn Muhammad (a.s.) was brought ’Isma‘il said to him,  May Allah take my soul in service for your cause, if you could explain to him we perhaps will  all be spared.\" He said, \"I have decided not to talk to him. Let him do whatever he wants.\"  ’Isma‘il said to abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.), \"By Allah, tell me if you remember the day I came to see  your father, Muhammad ibn Ali (a.s.) and I had two pieces of yellow cloths on me. He looked  at me for a long time and wept. I asked for the reason. I wept because you will be killed when  very old for no reason and not even two goats will fight for you (no one will ask justice for  you). I said, \"When is that? He said, it will happen when you will be called to follow  falsehood and you will refuse. When you will see the abusive oblique eyed person whose  people from the family of al-Hassan (a.s.) on the pulpit of the Messenger of Allah call people  to follow him and would give himself a name that he does not deserve. At such time you must  renew your covenant, make your will because you will be murdered on that day or the next  day.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) said, \"Yes, by the Lord of the Ka‘ba he will not fast in the month  of Ramadan except few days. I leave in the trust of Allah, O abu al-Hassan. May Allah grant  us great reward for loosing you. May He grant well being to those whom you leave behind.  We are for Allah and to Him we will return.\" The narrator has said that ’Isma‘il was carried  away and ‘Abdallah (a.s.) was sent to prison. He has said, \"By Allah, only that evening the  sons of his brother, the sons of Mu‘awiya ibn ‘Abdallah ibn Ja'far went on him and crushed  (his bones) under their feet. Muhammad ibn ‘Abdallah released Ja'far (a.s.). The narrator has  said when it was the month of Ramadan ‘Isa ibn Musa began his uprising to occupy Madina.  He has said that Muhammad ibn ‘Abdallah came with Yazid ibn Mu‘awiya ibn ‘Abdallah ibn  Ja'far leading his army. In fron of the army of ‘Isa ibn Musa there were the sons of al-Hassan  ibn Zayd ibn al-Hassan ibn al-Hassan ibn al-Qasim and Muhammad ibn Zayd, Ali and  Ibrahim sons of al-Hassan ibn Zayd. Yazid ibn Mu‘awiya was defeated and ‘Isa ibn Musa  came to Madina. Fighting took place in Madina. ‘Isa camped at mount Dhubab. The blacks  (army of Abbassides) came from the backside. Muhammad with his people went up to the  maket place. Then followed them to the mosque of al-Khawamin. There he looked around.  There was no black or white (people opposed to Abbassides) soldiers. He advanced to  ShaKa‘ba Faraza then to Hudhayl then he went to al-Ashja‘. Here a horse man about whom  abu ‘Abdallah had spoken came out from the doorway of Hudhayl and struck him a blow. It  did not do anything to him. He attacked the horse man and cut the nose of his horse with  sword. The horse man hit him that penetrated in the coat of arms Muhammad bent on him and  hit him killed him. Then Hamid ibn Qahtaba came on him when he was turning away from  the horse man. He was hit from the alley of al-‘Ammariyin. One hit of the spear penetrated in  his coat of arms but the spear broke. He attacked Hamid and hit him with the spear. Hamid  then with the iron part of the broken spear hit him fatally he them came down hit him until he  was dead. He took his head away. The soldiers came from all sides and Madina was taken and  we were exiled all over the places.\"  Musa ibn ‘Abdallah has said, \"I then left until I met Ibrahim ibn ‘Abdallah. I found ‘Isa ibn Zayd hiding. I told him of his bad management and left with him until he died. I then  continued with the son of my brother, al-Ashtar ‘Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Abdallah ibn  Hassan until he also died in Sind. I then came back with no place to go to and afraid I  remembered what abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) had said. I came to al-Mahdi (an Abbasside ruler) in  Hajj where he was speaking to people in the shadow of the walls of Ka‘ba. He did not notice  when stood up below the pulpit. I said, \"Can I have immunity, O Amir al-Mu’minin if would  give you a good advise?\" He said, \"Yes, but what is it?\" I said, \"I can show you where Musa  ibn ‘Abdallah ibn Hassan is.\" He said, \"Yes, you will have security. I said, \"I ask for  guarantees. I then asked for covenant and affirmation until I was certain of the security then I  said, \"I am Musa ibn ‘Abdallah. He said, \"you are respected and you will live.\" I then asked  to show one of his people who would support me for living. He said, \"Look whoever you like.  I said your uncle, Abbass ibn Muhammad should support me. He refused. I begged him then  he agreed. Al-Mahdi asked, \"Who knows you?\" Most of them, our people were around him. I  said, \"This al-Hassan ibn Zayd, knows me. This Musa ibn Ja'far (a.s.) knows me. This al- Hassan ibn ‘Abdallah ibn ‘Abbass knows me. They said, \"Yes, O Amir al-Mu’minin we  know him as if he was not absent from us.\" I then said to al-Mahdi, \"O Amir al-Mu’minin, the  father of this man had told me of this position. I pointed out to Musa ibn Ja'far (a.s.). Musa  ibn ‘Abdallah said, \"You have lied against him.\" I said, \"He commanded me to convey  greetings to you.\" He said, \"He is a just and generous Imam.\" He has said, \"Then he ordered  to give five thousand Dinars to Musa ibn Ja'far (a.s.). Musa ibn Ja'far (a.s.) ordered to give me  two thousand out of it. He introduced me to his people and his people to me. As the sons of  Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn are mentioned you should say, \"May Allah and His angels,  the carriers of His throne, the angels writing the deeds send blessing up on them specially abu  ‘Abdallah. May Allah grant Musa ibn Ja'far on behalf good rewards. I, by Allah, am servant  after being the servant of Aallah.\"",

Of the reliable and God fearing people who have come  to me have informed me about your sympathy towards us and your refusal to support us. I  consulted about calling people to pledge allegiance to such person from the family of  Muhammad (s.a) who is acceptable to people. You disagreed and your father had disagreed  before you. Since a long time you had claimed what was not for you. You expanded your  hopes towards what Allah did not grant you. You followed your desires and strayed. I warn  you of what Allah has warned about.\"Abu al-Hassan, Musa ibn Ja'far (a.s.) wrote to him as herein below, \"From Musa ibn abu ‘Abdallah , Ja'far (a.s.) and Ali (a.s.) who both will share the rewards for their humbleness  before Allah and obedience to Him, to Yahya ibn ‘Abdallah ibn Hassan. Thereafter, I warn  you of being mindless about Allah as I warn myself about as such about Him. I ask you to  know about His painful torments, severe punishments and His complete penalties. I  recommend you as well as my self to be pious before Allah. Piety before Allah is the beauty  in speech and the establishmmen of the blessings. I received your letter in which you have  said that I and my father have the claim (for leadership) from long before and that you have  not heard it from me (personally). \"Their testimony will soon be recorded and they will be  questioned about it. The greed for worldly gains have left nothing to gain from the benefits of  the next life, in fact, their gains and the benefits of the next life are destroyed for their worldly  desires. You have mentioned that I keep people from following you because of my desire to  achieve what you have achieved. In fact, weakness in the (knowledge of) Sunna or lack of  understanding of the authoritative evidence are not holding me back from what you are  involved in. The fact of the matters is that Allah has created people diffeent from each other  in instincts. I like to ask just about two letters. What are called al-‘Atra and al-Sahlaj in  human body? Write your answer to me. About yourself, I warn you about disobeying the  Khalifa and exhort you to be good to him and obey him. I ask you to request immunity for  yourself from him before the paws will catch you and the pressure squeeze everywhere. Then  you will try to find relief but you will not find it. Try until Allah will grant you from His  blessings na generosity and make Khalifa (may he live long) to sympathize you, be kind to  you and preserve in you the relation with the Messenger of Allah . With best regards and  peace for those who follow guidance. To us it is revealed that punishment is for those reject  and turn away (from the truth).Al-Ja'fari has said that it has come to my knowledge that this letter Musa ibn Ja'far (a.s.) had reached to Harun. When he saw it he said, \"People exhort me to act against Musa ibn Ja'far (a.  s.) while he is clean of what they accuse him of.\"",

In fact, he is lost and  confused and Allah disdains his deeds. Such person’s case and example is like a sheep that  has lost the shepherd and the flock that runs back and forth the whole day. As the night would  fall that sheep would see a flock of sheep with a shepherd. The (lost) sheep would then join  the flock affectionately that in fact is only a deception. The sheep would pass the night in  their shelter but when the shepherd would lead the flock to the pasture the lost sheep would  feel lost and away from the flock and the shepherd,. thus, run back and forth in search of the  flock and the shepherd. Then it would find a flock of sheep with a shepherd and affectionately  join them but, in fact, suffer a deception. This shepherd would shout at the lost sheep saying,  \"Go and find your own flock and shepherd you are lost, confused and without a flock and  shepherd. The lost sheep then would run back and forth in confusion, fear and frustration  without a shepherd to guide to the pasture and to the shelter. While the lost sheep is in such  confusion a wolf would seize the opportunity and would kill the lost sheep for food. Thus, by  Allah, O Muhammad is the case of a person from this ’Umma (nation) who would live  without an Imam (Leader with Divine Authority) from Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most  gracious, who is clearly supported with evidence and is just in his dealings. A person without  such Imam is lost and confused and if he would die in such condition his death would be like  dying in disbelief and hypocrisy. O Muhammad, bear in mind properly that the unjust Imams  and their followers are far away from the religion of Allah. They are lost and misleading.  Their deeds that they do are like the dust blown by the winds away in a windy day which,  would go out of hand without benefits. Thus is straying far away from the truth.\"",

She said, \"He had told me when there were only two of us (She was beloved to him),  \"Keep this trust well protected with you and do allow anyone to know it before I will die.  When I will die whichever of my sons will come to and ask you to deliver this trust to him  give it to him and know that I have passed away. The sign that my master had informed me of  has exactly come.\" He took charge of the package and money from her and commanded  everyone to keep it secret until the coming of the news. He left the house and thereafter did  not come to rest at night as before. After a few days only the news of the passing away of abu  Ibrahim reach the city. We calculated the time and found out that it was exactly the time abu  al-Hassan had done those things; his delaying to come for rest at night and taking charge of  the trust with (’Umm Ahamd).\"",

Have you not heard the words of Allah that say, \"He  said, \"I am the servant of God. He has given me the Book and has appointed me to be a  Prophet (19:30). He has blessed me no matter where I dwell, commanded me to worship Him  and pay the religious tax for as long as I live.\" (19:31) I then said, \"Was he the Divine  authority over Zackaria at the time that he was in the cradle?\" He said, \"At that time Jesus  was a sign from Allah and a blessing to Mary (Maryam) when he spoke on her behalf. He was  a prophet and a Divine authority over all those who heard his words at that time. Thereafter  he did not speak until he was two years old. At Such time Zackaria was the Divine authority  of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, over the people after the silence of Jesus.  Zackaria then died and his son Yahya (John) inherited the book and wisdom and he was a  small child. You can hear it in the words of Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, \"We  commanded John, Zachariah's son), \"O John, follow the guidance of the Lord with due  steadfastness. We gave knowledge and wisdom to John during his childhood.\" (19:12) When  Jesus became seven years he then spoke as a prophet and a messenger until Allah, the Most  Holy sent him inspiration. Thus, Jesus was the Divine authority over John and over all the  people. The earth is never left without the presence of a Divine authority over the people, O  abu Khalid, from the day Allah created Adam and settled him on earth.\" I then said, May  Allah take my soul in service for your cause, \"Did Ali (a.s.) possess Divine authority from  Allah and His Messenger over this nation (Muslims) during the life time of the Messenger of  Allah?\" He said, \"Yes, but he kept silent and did not speak along with the Messenger of  Allah. At that time, during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah, obedience was of the rights  of the Messenger of Allah over the ’Umma (nation) and over Ali (a.s.). Obedience on the  authority of Allah and the Messenger of Allah over the people as a whole was obligatory to  Ali (a.s.) after the death of the Messenger of Allah.

When we arrived at al-Abwa lunch was served . When  he would serve food to his people he would serve good and plentiful food. At such time the  messenger of Hamida, (his wife), came saying, \"Hamida says, \"I have almost lost my self and  I have found what I was to find, I am about to give birth. You had commanded me not to do  anything to this child without you.\" Abu ‘Abdallah (a.s.) left with the messenger. When he  came back his companions congratulated him and said, \"May Allah take our souls in service  for your cause, what did you do to Hamida?\" He said, \"Allah granted her good health and  gifted me with a boy whom He has formed as the best in His creatures. Hamida informed me  of a matter about him that she thought I did not know. I, however, knew it better than her.\" I  then asked him, May Allah take my soul in service for your cause, what was it that Hamida  told you about the child?\" He said that she informed him about the baby’s actions as soon as  he fell on the ground. \"The baby placed his hands on the ground and raised his head to the  sky.\" I explained to her that it was a sign like that of the Messenger of Allah and a sign of the  executor of his will after him.\" I then said, \"May Allah take my soul in service for your cause,  what sign is the sign of the Messenger of Allah and the sign of the executor of his will after  him?\" He said to me, \"In the night that the mother of my grandfather conceived him someone  came to my great grandfather with a drink finer than water, softer than butter, sweeter than  honey, cooler than ice and whiter than milk. He was asked to drink it and then go to bed with  his wife. He went to bed with his wife and she conceived with the baby. In the night that the  mother of my father conceived him someone came to my grandfather with the same kind of  drink as that brought to my great-grandfather. He was asked to drink it as my great- grandfather had done. He was commanded to do as my great grandfather had done. He then  went to bed with his wife and she conceived with my father. In the night that my mother  would conceive with me someone came to my father with the same kind of drink as that  brought for my great-grandfather and grandfather and made him to drink as they had done and  commanded him as he had commanded them before him. He then went to bed with his wife  and my mother conceived with me. In the night that my wife was to conceive with my son  someone came to me with the same kind of drink as that for my great grandfather, my   grandfather and my father. He did to me as he done to them. I then went with the knowledge of Allah and with joy for what Allah had granted to me to bed with my wife and she  conceived with the baby that is just born. The newborn is with you and he, by Allah, will be  your companion after me. The seed of the Imam is from what I just explained to you. When  the seed is accommodated in the womb for four months and the spirit is established therein  Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, then send an angel. This angel is called Haywan  (animal or living). He then writes on his right shoulder \". . .in all truth and justice, your Lord's  Word has been completed. No one can change His Words. He is All-hearing and All- knowing.\". (6:115) When he comes out of his mothers womb he places his hands on the floor  and raises his head to the sky. Placing his hands on earth is an indication of his taking  possession of all the knowledge of Allah that is sent from the heavens to earth. Raising his  head to the sky is that because a caller from inside the Throne calls him from the high horizon  with his name and the name of his father. It is for (on behalf of) the Lord, the Most Majestic,  the Most gracious, saying, \"O so and so, son of so and so. Be firm so that you would be  established. For the great purpose that I have created you, you are my chosen one in my  creatures. You are the keeper of My secrets, the container of My knowledge, the trustee of  My inspiration and My deputy and representative on earth. I have made it necessary for My  blessings and mercy to reach you and those who would love you (and acknowledge your  Divine Authority). I have gifted My paradise and given a place near Myself to you and to  them. Also, by My Majesty and Grace, I will make your enemies to feel the heat of My  punishment even though I may have given them expanded prosperity in My world such as  prosperity in their livelihood. When the call of caller ends he responds to it by placing his  hands on the ground and raising his head to the sky and says the following. \"God Himself  testifies that He is the only Lord. The angels and the men of knowledge and justice testify that  God is the only Lord, the Majestic, and All-wise.\" (3:18)The Imam (a.s.) said, \"When he says this, Allah grants him the knowledge of the fist and the knowledge of the last the qualification to be visited by the spirit in the nights of destiny.\" I  then said, may Allah take my soul in service for your cause, is the Spirit different from  Jibril?\" He said, \"The Spirit is a creature greater than Jibril. Jibril is of the angels. The Spirit  is a creature greater than the angels. Is it not true that Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High,  has said, \"On this Night, the angels and the Spirit descend . .\" .(97:4)Muhammad ibn Yahya and Ahmad ibn Muhammad have narrated from Muhammad ibn al-Husayn from Ahmad ibn al-Hassan from al-Mukhtar ibn Ziyad from Muhammad ibn  Sulayman from his father from abu Basir a similar hadith.",

Two of them were  Suhari (made in Suhar, Yemen) and one Hibara (made in Hibara, Yemen). Burd (fabric made  in Yemen) was rare to find. ‘Abbad seemed frowning (as if he did not believe in the rarity of  the fabric) at this. The Imam (a.s.) said, \"The palm tree of (from which) Mary was ‘Ajwa (a  kind of palm tree) and it had come from the heavens. Whatever grew from its roots they were  also ‘Ajwa and whatever grew from its date-stones it became of lower quality.\" When they   left The Imam (a.s.) ‘Abbad ibn Kathir said to ibn Shurayh, \"By Allah, I did not understand his simile that abu ‘Abdallah put forward to me.\" Ibn Shurayh then said, \" Ask this boy  (Maymun al-Qaddah). He will explain it to you because he is from them.\" He then ask the  boy and he said, \" Is it true that you did not understand what he said to you?\". He ‘Abbad  said, \"No, by Allah, I did not understand.\" The boy, Maymun al-Qaddah, then said, \"The  refers to his own self. He informed you that he is one of the children of the Messenger of  Allah and the knowledge of the Messenger of Allah is with them.

By Allah, Allah has not  required anyone to bear it except us nor has He required anyone to worship him in that way  except us.

However, we did not find a proper  place for it or a people or bearers who accept it until Allah created certain tribes. These  people were created from the clay out of which Muhammad and his descendants were created  and from a light from which Allah had created Muhammad and his descendants. He made   them with the excess of the making of His blessings out of which He had made Muhammad and his descendants. We then preached what Allah had commanded us to preach then these  people accepted and acknowledged that. [It reached them from us and they accepted and  acknowledged it]. Our mention reached them and their hearts inclined towards us,  recognizing us and our hadith. Had they not been created from this they would not have been  as such. No, by Allah, they would not have acknowledged.\"Then the Imam (a.s.) said, \"Allah created certain tribes for Hell and fire. He then commanded us to preach to them as we had preached to them but to the later ones it seemed repugnant and  their hearts felt hatred and they rejected it from us, did not acknowledge it and considered it  as lies and they said, \"They are magicians and liars.\" Allah then placed a seal on their hearts  and made them to forget. Allah then opened their tongue with some of the truth. Thus, they  speak of it but their hearts are in denial. He uses it in defense of His friends and those who  obey Him. Had it not been there no one would have worshipped Allah on earth. He  commanded us to withheld it from them, hide and conceal. You must also hide it from those  that Allah has commanded to withheld from and hide from those that Allah has commanded  to hide and withheld from.\" The narrator has said that the Imam (a.s.) then raised his hands  and wept and said, \"O Lord, this is a very small group. Make our lives as their lives and our  death like their death. Do not make dominant over them any of Your enemies that would  cause us suffer pains for their suffering.

Ali ibn Ibrahim has narrated from al-Sarriy ibn al-Rabi‘ who has said the following. \"Ibn abu ’Umayr would not consider anyone a match of Hisham ibn al-Hakam in anything. He would  not miss meeting him. However, their relations at a time stood at a distance. The reason for  this was the emrgence of diffirences between ibn abu ‘Umayr and and abu Malik al-Hadrami,  a friend of Hisham, over the issue of Imamat. Ibn abu ‘Umayr had said that the whole world  belongs to the Imam in the form of property and ownership and that he has more authority  over it than those who have certain parts of it in their possession. Abu Malik had said that it is  not as such. The peoples properties belong to them except what Allah has given to the Imam  in the form of windfall profits and one fifth taxes or interests. Such properties belong to the  Imam and Allah has instructed him how to spent them and what to do with them. They agreed  to ask Hisham to settle the differences. They went to Hisham but he supported the idea of abu  Malik. Ibn abu ‘Umayr became angry and distanced himself from Hisham thereafter.\"",

The Hadith is about the protest of Amir al-Mu’minin (a.s.) against ‘Asim ibn Ziyad who had  confined himself in a gown away from the people. His brother, al-Rabi‘ ibn Ziyad complained  before Amir al-Mu’minin (a.s.) complained that his ‘Asim’s family had become depressed   and his sons had been sadden because of his behavior. Amir al-Mu’minin (a.s.) had summoned ‘Asim ibn Ziyad and was brought before him. When Amir al-Mu’minin (a.s.) saw  him he frowned at him and said, \"Why did you not feel ashamed before your wife? Why did  you not show kindness to your sons? Do you think Allah had made good things lawful to and  then He would dislike if you would use them? You are less significant to Allah than such a  thing. Is it not Allah Who has said, \"He spread out the earth for the people (55:10). There  exists all kinds of fruits, palm-trees with sheathed blossoms, (55:11) grain with its husk and  aromatic herbs (55:12).

Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most  gracious, has made obligatory for the Imams of justice to measure themselves with the people  of lowest standard of living so that the poors’ poverty would plunge him in despair.\" ‘Asim  then abandoned the gown and begun to live an normal life.\"",

His association was suspicious and his lineage was not  unknown to the people of knowledge to describe.

No person of Hashimit  descent has ever reached the level of his discipline to become parallel to him and no person of  the inhabitants of Abtah has ever climbed to his high position. Restraint was of his attributes  and generosity was part of his nature. He was made with the dignity of prophet-hood and its  discipline.

The means and measures of Allah brought him to the appointed time and the decree by the  commands of Allah continued to their goals. The determined decision of Allah delivered him  to their objects. Every nation would gave the glad news about him to the one thereafter and  every father would deliver to the next one from one generation to the next.

You were the first in  the nation who accepted Islam and were of the purest faith among them. You were of the  most solid certainty and feared Allah the most among them. The degree of your hard work  (for the cause of Allah) was the greatest and you were the most cautious in protecting the  Messenger of Allah among them. You were the most trusted in the affairs of his companions  and of the most distinguished in excellence, of the most honorable past credentials, of the  highest degree of virtue and the closest as relatives to the Messenger of Allah among them.  You were the most similar among them to him (the Messenger of Allah) in the matters of  providing guidance, moral discipline, mannerism and deeds. You were the most precious to  him (the Messenger of Allah) among them, in value and the most honorable to him among  them. May Allah grant you good rewards on behalf of Islam, His Messenger and the Muslims.  You exercised strength when his (the Messenger of Allah’s) companions became weak. You  would come out (to face the enemy) when they showed humiliation, you rose up whenever  showed laziness. You maintained steadfastness in adherence to the system of the Messenger  of Allah whenever his companions attended othewise. You, indeed, were his undisputed  successor and you did not cause strife 9in the community) despite the mischief of the  hypocrites, of the anger of the unbelievers, the dislike of the jealous ones, and lowliness of the  transgressors. You stood firm for the truth when they failed, spoke clearly when they became  speechless, marched forwards in the light of Allah and they halted and if they followed you  they found the right guidance. You were the softest in tone and of the highest degree of prayer  among them, of the smallest amount of speech and of the most correct and valid statements.  You were of the greatest ideas, of the bravest heart, of the most solid certainty, of the best of  deeds and the most knowledgeable of the issues among them. You, by Allah, were the lead   figure in religion at first and at last. You were the first when people digressed in chaos and the last when they failed. Your as a kind father to the believers as they become dependent up on  you and you bore such burdens that others felt much weak to carry. Your protected what they  had lost and guarded what they had ignored. You tightened your belt when they accumulated  (wealth with greed), you rose high when they despaired (in humiliation). You exercised  patience when they rushed and you achieved what they had never dreamed to achieve and  through you they gained what they had never expected to gain. You were as pouring calamity  and disaster up on the unbelievers and the fortress and support for the believers. You were  invented for the task of Leadership with Divine Authority with its blessing and you succeeded  to achieve its awards, established its prerequisite and left with its distinctions. Your evidence  in support your divine Authority never last its sharp edge and your heart never wavered, your  intelligence never weakened, your soul did not falter or become frightened. You were like a  mountain that strong winds could not move. It is just as the Holy Prophet (s.a) has said,  \"People lived secure in your company and their property well preserved in your hands.\" You  were just as the Holy Prophet (s.a) has said, \"Physically weak but very strong to support the  cause of Allah, of a very humble soul, but very great in the sight of Allah, the chief on earth  and majestic in the sight of the believers. No one could ever find faults with you or advance  criticism. No one could ever involve you in corruption. You never showed anyone (corrupt)  compliance. The weak and feeble to you were strong popular until you would restore their  rights and the powerful and popular were weak and feeble to you until you would make to  yield to others rights. People of close relation or otherwise were all equal to you in such cases.  You aimed the truth, the true and kindness. Your words were law and final and your  commands were based on forbearance and determination your view was knowledge and the  final decision in what you would do. The system is established, the pitfalls are routed, the  fires (of mischief) are extinguished, religious issues are balanced and through you Islam has  become strong. The guidance of Allah has become manifest even though the unbelievers  dislike. Islam, the through you, and the believers are strengthened. You have raced (for  Divine excellence) a long race and cause a great deal of weariness to those behind you.  Losing you can never be compensated with weeping and your death is a great issue in  heavens and it has threatened the people (with emergence of chaos). \"We are the servants of  God and to Him we shall all return.\" (2:156) We accept the decision of Allah and submit to  His commands. By Allah, the Muslims will never find any one like you. You were a fortress  and the stronghold like a heavy mountain and the intense anger for the unbelievers. May  Allah join you with His Holy Prophet (s.a). May Allah not deprive us of your rewards and  keep us safe against mis-guidance after you. People remained silent until he finished his  words. He wept and the companions of the Messenger of Allah wept. Thereafter, they  searched for him but he was nowhere to be found.\"",

When abu Ja‘far (a.s.) arrived he made a gesture with his hand to  all of them and offered a general greeting. He then sat down. This increased the  disappointment of Hisham because he did not he did not address him as the caliph and sat  down without his permission. Hisham then began to reprimand and scold him and said to him  among other things, \"O Muhammad ibn Ali, why is it that one or the other from cause  disunity among the Muslims and call people to follow him thinking that he is the Imam  because of his ignorance and foolishness. He scolded him as much as he wanted. When he  became quite others one after the other began to annoy and nag him. When they all became  quite, he rose and stood up and said, \"O people, what is that you want and where are you  headed? Through us, Allah granted you guidance to the first one of you and through us the   last of you can receive guidance. If you have a temporary power to us belongs the future power and there will be no power after our power because to us belong the consequences as  Allah, the Most Majestic, the Most gracious, has said, \"The final victory is for the pious  ones.\" (7:128).\" He ordered to imprison him.

I am not responsible for your deeds.\" (11:86) The Imam (a.s.)  has said that among them there was an old man who went to them (people of the town) and  said, \"By Allah, this is the call of Shu‘ayb the Prophet of Allah. If you would not go to this  man in the marketplaces, you will be seized from the above and below. Believe me and obey  me this time but you may reject me next time.

At this time we were with  him in al-‘Urayd. The Christian man said, \"I have come to you from a far away place after a  difficult journey. I have been praying to my Lord for thirty years to guide me to the best of  the religions and to the best of the servants (of Allah) and the most knowledgeable among  them.

He said , \"I am the most knowledgeable  one among the people who follow my religion but other than me is more knowledgeable than  me I then asked him to guide me to the one who is more knowledgeable than him because I  like traveling and I can endure difficulties. I have read the whole Gospel, the Psalms of David  and the four parts of Torah. I have read the apparent text of the whole Quran. The scholar  then said to me, \" If you would like Christianity I am the most knowledgeable person in it  among the Arab and none Arab people. If you would like the knowledge of Judaism then Bati  ibn Shurahbil al-Samari is the most knowledgeable person in that religion today. However,  you may like to learn the knowledge of Islam, the knowledge of Torah, the knowledge of the  Gospel, the knowledge of Psalms, the book of Hud and all that is revealed to any of the  prophets in your time or in the times of the others. You may like to learn all that has come  from the heavens in the form of information. People may have learned or not learned such  information. In such information there is the explanation for everything, the cure for the  worlds, the spirit for those who wish to have comfort, understanding in what Allah has willed  to be for their good and seek intimacy with the truth. I can guide you to a person who can  teach you all such things). Go to him even if you would have to walk to him on foot. If would  not be able to walk then you must crawl to him on your knees. If you would be able to do that  also then you must drag yourself on your hips. If you would be able to reach him that way  you must move to him on your face.\" I then said, \" No, none of these is necessary. I can walk  to him. Physically I am capable and financially I am capable.\" He then said, \"Go on to him  without any delay until you will reach Yathrib.\" I said, \"I do not know where Yathrib is?\" He  said, \"Go until you reach Madina of the Holy Prophet (s.a.) who was raised among the Arabs.  He was a prophet from the Arabs, from the tribe of al-Hashim. When you will arrive there ask  for banu Ghanam ibn Malik ibn al-Najjar who is near the door of the Mosque in that city.  Show your self to him in the Christian dress because their governor is strict on them and the  caliph is even stricter on them. Thereafter ask for the tribe of banu ‘Amr ibn Mabdhul that is  in the area of al-Zubayr. Then ask for Musa ibn Ja‘far and his house and that where he  himself is that is he on a journey or at home. If he would be on a journey then you must reach  him because his destination is shorter than the distance you have to travel. When you will  meet him say that the chief monk of al-Ghuta, Ghuta of Damascus guided me to you. That he   asked me to convey his great deal greetings of peace to you and has said to you the following. \"I pray to my Lord very often to make my Islam take form in your hands.\"The Christian man told this story of his dream while he was standing and supporting himself with his staff.

Do you not return the greetings of peace?\" Abu al-Hassan (a.s.) said,  \"The answer to your friend is that he must accept Islam. The greeting of peace will be  returned when he will accept our religion.\" The Christian man then said, \"I like to ask you  questions, may Allah grant you well being.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"Ask your questions.\" He  said, \"Tell me about the book that Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has revealed to  Muhammad that he read to people and introduced it to them the way he did.

The ‘illustrious book’ stands for Amir al- Mu’minin Ali (a.s.)

However I will describe the third of these people and his descendants and he is mentioned in  your books revealed to you. If you have not altered and changed and reject them as you have  been doing so for a long time.\" The Christian man said, \"I will not hide from you what I know  and will not lie to you and you already know what I will say is true and what is false. By  Allah, He has granted you through His grace so much distinction and has given the  opportunity through His bounties so much that people can not even think how much they are?

What was the date when Jesus was born and during which hour of the day?\" The  Christian man said, \"I do not know.\" Abu Ibrahim then said, \"The name of the mother of  Mary was Martha and ‘Wahayba’ in Arabic. The day Mary conceived with Jesus was a Friday  at noontime. It was the day in which the trusted spirit descended and among the Muslims  there is no holiday of greater preference than this. Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, has  advanced it with greatness and Muhammad (s.a) has venerated it with greatness. He   commanded it to be observed as a holiday, thus, it is the day of congregation. The day in which Mary was born was a Tuesday four and a half hour before noon. Do you know the river  on the side of which Mary gave birth to Jesus?\" The Christian man said, \"No, I do not know  it.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"It was Euphrates that has palm trees and vineyards on its banks. No  other place is like Euphrates for vineyards and palm trees. Have you noticed the day in which  her tongue was curtained in speaking and Qaydus (the king of Israel) called his sons and  subjects for support to take the family of ‘Imran out and look at Mary?

The name of your mother in Arabic was Mayyata. The name of your father was  ‘Abd al-Masih and it is ‘Abdallah in Arabic. Al-Masih (Messiah) did not have any servant.\"  The Christian man said, \"You have spoken the truth and did a good deed. Would you tell me  what the name of my grandfather was?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"The name of your grandfather  was Gibrael and I call him ‘Abd al-Rahman in this our meeting.\" The Christian man asked,  \"Was he a Muslim?\" Abu Ibrahim (a.s.) said, \"Yes, he was a Muslim and he was martyred.  Soldiers attacked him and murdered him in his home senselessly and the soldiers were from  the people of Damascus.\" The Christian man asked, \"What was my name before my Kunya  (such as ‘abu’ so and so or ‘ibn’ so and so)?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"It was ‘Abd al-Salib.\"  The Christian man asked, \"What name would you like to give me?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"I  will call you ‘Abdallah.\" The Christian man said, \"I then declare my faith in Allah the great  and testify that there is no lord besides Allah Who is One and no one is His partner. He is  One, Self-sufficient. He is not like what the Christians describe Him. He is not like what the  Jews describe Him. He is not a genus of the categories of polytheism. I testify that  Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger. He has sent him with all truth. He has  manifested the truth to the people of truth and has turned the people of falsehood blind. That  Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah to all mankind, red and black all alike. Thus, those  who have understanding have understood and those who sought guidance have received  guidance. The people of falsehood have turned blind and have lost what they were calling. I  testify that His representative His Wali (the Leader with Divine Authority) have spoken with  His wisdom. That all the prophets before him had spoken with pure wisdom, supported each  other in obedience to Allah and stayed away from falsehood and the people of falsehood and  filth and the people of filth. That they kept aloof from error and that Allah supported them  through obedience to Him and kept them infallible and sinless. Thus, they were the Awliya’  of Allah, possessing Divine Authority and the protectors of religion. They encouraged others  to do good and commanded them to do so. I declare my faith in the small ones among them  and greater ones among them, those of them whom I have mentioned as well as those that I  have not mentioned. I declare my faith in Allah, the Most Holy, the Most High, the Lord of  the worlds\" He then cut off his necktie and the cross that was made of gold and hanged from his neck. He   then said, \"Command me as you would wish as to who must I pay charities due on me.’ The Imam (a.s.) said, \"There is one of your brethren in religion and he is of your own people, from  Qays ibn al-Tha‘laba and is doing well financially like your self. You must cooperate with  each other and be lenient to each other and I will not allow that your rights in Islam be  ignored.\" He then said, \"By Allah,-may Allah grant you well being- I am doing very well  financially. In my town I have three hundred horses male and female and a thousand camels.  Your rights in them is more than mine.\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"You are the slave of Allah and  His Messenger and your lineage is natural.\" He improved himself in Islam and married a lady  from the tribe of Fihr. Abu Ibrahim (a.s.) paid her dowry (marriage gift) which was fifty  Dinars from the charities of Ali ibn abu Talib (a.s.). He hired for him a servant and provided  him accommodation until abu Ibrahim (a.s.) was taken (to Baghdad). Thereafter he died only  after twenty eight days.\"",

The Imam (a.s.) ordered to spread  a mat that was made of palm tree fibers. He then sat down on it and the people sat down on  The Imam (a.s.).The nun began asking questions. She asked may questions. The Imam (a.s.)  answered them all. Abu Ibrahim (a.s.) asked her certain questions but she could not answer.  She then accepted Islam.The monk then began to ask questions and the Imam (a.s.) would answer whatever he would ask. The monk then said, \"I was very strong in my religion and no one of the Christians was  as knowledgeable as I am. I heard of man from India who could go for pilgrimage to the Holy  House in one day and one night and then go back to India to his home. I asked as to where did  he live? I was told that he lived in Sibdhan. The one who informed me about him said that he  knew the knowledge with which Asaf, the companion of Solomon brought the throne of  Sheba before Solomon. He is the one whom Allah has mentioned in your book and in the  books of the followers of the Bible.\" Abu Ibrahim (a.s.) then said, \"How many are the names  of Allah that if invoke would not leave one without the desired result?\" The monk said, \"They  are many but the ones with perfect effects that do not leave the person invoking them without  the desired results are seven.\" Abu al-Hassan (a.s.) asked him, \"Tell of whichever that you  know.\" The monk said, \"By Allah, who has sent the Torah to Moses and has made Jesus to be  a lesson for the worlds and a trial for the thankfulness of the people of reason, Who has made  Muhammad (s.a.) to be a blessing and mercy and has made Ali (a.s.) a lesson and the source  of understanding, Who has made the executors of his will from his descendants and the   descendants of Muhammad (s.a.) that I do not know.\" Had I known them you would not have to ask me, I would not have come to you and would have asked you questions.\" Abu Ibrahim  (a.s.) then said, \"Tell me more about the man from India.\" The monk said, \"I have heard  certain names but I do not know their meanings and interpretations. I do not know what they  are and how they are and how they are read? I journeyed until I reached Sidhan in India. I  asked about the man and I was told that he has built a monastery in the mountain and can only  be seen twice a yea. The people of India believe that Allah has made a stream flow through  his monastery. They think that a different kincheloe, MI 49784 of farming is done for him  therein and that all is done for him without normal labor. I then went to his door and waaited  for three days without knocking and trying to open the door. On the fourth day Allah opened  the door. A cow loaded wth fire wood came. Her breast was so heavily filled with milk that it  would almost touch the ground and the milk would almost to come out. The cow pushed the  door open and I followed her. I found the man in a standing position looking towards the sky  and would weep. Then he would look to the earth and weep. He would look at the mountains  and would weep. I said, \"Glory belongs to Allah. How few are the people like you in our  times.\" He said, \"By Allah, I am only one good of the deeds of the one whom you have left  behind you.\" I then said, \"I am told that you know certain names of the name s of Allah  through which you can reach every day and night the Holy house that is in al-Sham (Syria). Is  it true?\"He asked me, \"Do you recognize the Holy House?\" I replied, \"I do not know any  other Holy House besides that in al-Sham.\" He said, \"Not Bayt al-Maqdis (the mosque in  Jerusalem). The Holy House that is the House of the family of Muhammad (s.a.).\" I then said,  \"What I have heard up to this day is the Holy House that I just mentioned.\" He said, \"That is  the place where the prophets worshipped Allah. It had been called the center of the places of  worship until the period between the time of Jesus and the coming of Muhammad (s.a.) in  which the calamities approached the pagans and misfortune entered the houses of Satan. They  moved, changed and transferred those names as Allah has said in His words whose intrinsic  meaning stand for the family of Muhammad and apparently stand as a proverb, \"These are  only names given by yourselves and your fathers. God has not given them any  authority. . . .\"(53:23). I then said, to him, \"I have come to your from a far away land. On the  way I crossed , oceans, sadness, anxieties and fear. I have passed days and night in despair for  falling to reach my goal.\" He said to me, \"I do not see that your mother conceived with you at  any time without a noble angel with her. I never found your father without formal purification  whenever he would go to bed with your mother. He went to bed with her in purified  condition. I do not think there was any other reason except his reading the fourth part of the  Torah during his nightly vigil, thus, arrived with him to the good end. Go back jus as you  came. Leave until you reach Madina of Muhammad (s.a.) which also called the pure and  clean. In the age of darkness of ignorance they called it Yathrib. Then go a place therein  called al-Barqi’. Then ask for a house called the house of Marwan. Logde there for three days.  Then ask for a black old man who works with the fibers of the palm tree (to make mats and  other such things) that they call al-Khasf. Be kind to him and tell him, \"I am sent to you by  your guest who would stay with you in the corner of the house wherein there are the four  pieces of woods. Then ask him about so and so son of so and so. Ask him where he forms his  gathering and what time he passes thereby. He will show him to you or will give full   description and dyou recognize him through the description and I also describe him for you.\" .I said, \"After meeting him what would I do?\" He said, \"Ask him of whatever happened and  whatever will happen. Ask him about religious guidance of those past and those yet to come.\"  The narrator has said that abu Ibrahim (a.s.) said to him, \"Your friend who you met has given  you very good advise.\" The monk then asked the Imam (a.s.), \"What is his name, may Allah  take my soul in service for your cause,?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"His name is Mutammim ibn  Firuz from the people of Persia. He established faith in Allah Who is only One and has no  partners and worshipped Him sincerely with certainty and devotion. He ran away from his  people when was afraid of them. His Lord granted him authority and guided him to the way  of right guidance and progress. He made him to be of the pious ones and granted him the  knowledge of who the His sincere servants are. Every year he he visits Makka for Hajj and  performs ‘Umra at the beginning of every month once. He comes from his place in India to  Makka because of the distinction that Allah ahs granted to him and His support and thus  Allah rewards those who give thanks.\" The monk then asked him many questions. The Imam (a.s.) answered them all. He asked the monk certain questions which he could not answer but the Imam (a.s.) himself answered  them..The monk then said, \"Tell me of the eight letters that were revealed out of which four were manifested on earth and the other four remained in space. To who the four were sent thhe fpur  that remained in space? Who will interpret them?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"He will be our al- Qa’im (the one who will rise with Divine authority). Allah will sent them to him and he will  interpret them. He will sent to him what has not even been sent to the truthful ones, the  messengers and the rightly guided ones.\" Then the monk said, \"Tell me about the of the four  that were sent to earth. What are they?\" The Imam (a.s.) said, \"I will tell you about all four.  The first one was ‘there is no lord except Allah Who is One and has no partners that He is  eternal ’. The second was, ‘Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah purely’. The third one was  we the Ahl al-Bayt (infallible members of the family of Muhammad (s.a.). the fourth one was  our Shi‘a (followers) who are from us and we are from the Messenger of Allah and the  Messenger of Allah is from Allah through means.\" The monk then said, \"I testify that there is  no lord except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and that whatever he  brought from Allah is true and that your, Ahl al-Bayt (the infallible members of the family of  Muhammad (s.a.) are the chosen of Allah from His creatures and that you Shi‘a are pure who  are the replacement (of those who oppose you). They will have the good end. All thanks are  due to Allah, Lord of the worlds.\" Abu Ibrahim (a.s.) called to bring for him a gown, a shirt  made in Gha’in Khurasan, a scarf, a shoe and a hat. He gave them to him and prayed the noon  time prayer and asked him to circumcise. He said, \" It had been done when he was seven  years old.\"",

He was surrounded by the beggars and would   give them charity. He passed by and entered his house. Then he came out and called me inside. We both sat down and I began to speak to him about ibn al-Musayyib, the governor of  Madina as I would speak to him about the governor often.

Abu al-Hassan (a.s.) in reply presented  certain reason to justify his disagreement to the proposal but al-Ma’mun continued writing  until The Imam (a.s.) found it out to be unavoidable and that will not leave him alone. He (a. s.) then left for Khurasan when abu Ja‘far was only seven years old. Al-Ma’mun wrote to  him, \"do not travel through the mountains and Qum. Take the road through Basra, al-Ahwaz  and Persia. The Imam (a.s.) arrived at Marw. Al-Ma’mun offered him to command and lead  the task of Khilafat (Leadership) but abu al-Hassan (a.s.) declined. He then offered the Imam  (a.s.) to accept the post of the crown prince . The Imam (a.s.) said that he may accept it under  certain conditions.

You must excuse me in all such matters. Al-Ma’mun  agreed to all such conditions.

When we appeared before them in such fashion  and al-Rida (a.s.) appeared to them he stood at the door shortly and then said, \"Allahu Akbar  (Allah is great). Allahu Akbar (Allah is great). Allahu Akbar (Allah is great). Allahu Akbar  (Allah is great) for guidance that He has granted us. Allahu Akbar (Allah is great) that has  granted us the cattle. All praise belongs to Allah that He has granted us blessings. We all  would raise our voices. Yasir al-Khadim has said that the whole Maw shock with the  weeping, cries and shouts when they looked at abu al-Hassan (a.s.). Many of the guides fell  from their horses who would kick and throw their boots when they saw abu al-Hassan  barefoot. He would walk about ten steps and pause and say Allahu Akbar three times. Yasir al- Khadim has said that to us it seemed as if the sky, earth and mountains would respond to him.  The whole Marw had become one voice loud and tearful. Information of this was reported to  al-Ma’mun and Sahl ibn al-Fadl, who had two official posts, said to him, \"Amir al-Mu’minin,  if al-Rida would reach the place of prayer in this manner people will into his devotees. Ask  him to return home.\" Al-Ma’mun sent his people to ask abu al-Hassan to return home. He  asked to bring his shoes and wore them and rode back home.\"",

Fax l ibn Sahl had received a letter from his brother Z assan, while we were on our journey. Hassan had said in the letter, \"I studied the Zodiac changes this year according to the  astrological calculations. I found out in the month of so and so on a Wednesday you will feel  the test of iron and fire. I urged you to go to a Turkish bath with Ma’m7 n and Imam •••2 (a.s)  and perform phlebotomies and stain your hands with blood which, will help remove this  misfortune from you. Fax l ibn Sahl wrote about it to al-Ma’mun requesting him to request His Holiness Imam Ali ibn •7 •2 al-•••2 (a.s) to also join them on the appointed day. Al-Ma’m7 n informed the Holy  Imam of the contents of that letter and demanded the consent of His Holiness. In reply to the  caliph’s letter Imam al-•••• (a.s) wrote, \"I will not go to the Turkish bath tomorrow. You and  Fadl also must not go there tomorrow.\" He sent that letter to the Imam (a.s.) twice. Abu al- Hassan (a.s.) wrote to him, \"O Amir al-Mu’minin, \"I will not go to the Turkish bath. I have   seen in a dream the Holy Prophet (a.s) enjoining me not to go to that Turkish bath. You and Fadl also must not go to the Turkish bath.\" Al-Ma’mun replied the letter saying, \"You have  spoken the truth and so has the Messenger of Allah. I will not go to the Turkish bath  tomorrow and Fadl knows best.\" The narrator has said that Yasir said, \"When the night fell al- Rida (a.s.) told us to say, \"We seek refuge in Allah against the misfortune in this night. We  continued saying the expression. When al-Rida (a.s.) prayed the Morning Prayer he asked me  to climb at the roof and to listen if there is anything. When I climbed I heard a great deal of  commotion and crying and it was increasing. We saw al-Ma’mun enter from the door that  opened to his quarter from the quarter of abu al-Hassan (a.s.) and he said, \"My master, abu al- Hassan, may Allah grant you good reward for the death of Fadl. He refused to cancel his  decision for the bath and he went to the Turkish bath. A group of people attacked him with  swords and killed him. Three of the attackers were arrested and one of them was the son of  his maternal uncle, the son of Dhul al-Qalamayn. He then said that the police and the guides  and the people of Fadl present at the door of al-Ma’mun said, \"He has murdered him.\" They  killed him. They meant al-Ma’mun thereby.\" \"We revenge him.\" They set the door on fire.\"  Al-Ma’mun said to abu al-Hassan (a.s.), \"My master, please come out to them to calm them  down and ask them to disperse.\"The narrator has said that Yasir said, \"Abu al-Hassan (a.s.) rode and asked me to ride also.

When it was noontime he came on his donkey but he did not dismount at the place that he  would do so before. He came and dismounted on the rock in front the door of the Mosque. He  then entered the Mosque, turned to the Shrine of the Messenger of Allah and offered his  greeting of peace to the Messenger of Allah. his disembark.\" The narrator has said that then  he then turned to the place where he would pray.

I then  on that day went to the place and met the man from the family of al-Talha and began to talk to  him while waiting for him (the Imam (a.s.) to come. The owner of the place said to me, \"If  you want to use the bathhouse you must do now because latter on it will not be available.\" I   asked, \"Why is that?\" He said, \"Ibn al-Rida will come to use it.\" I then asked, \"Who is ibn al-Rida ?\" He said, \"A man from the family of Muhammad (s.a.).

In front of him there was a slave who carried a  piece of mat and brought it in all the way to the dressing-room where he spread it down. He  (the Imam) also came in offered his greeting of peace and entered the dressing-room while  stile riding on the donkey. He then dismounted on the mat.

The donkey was brought in the dressing-room and he  rode on the donkey from the top of the mat. And left.
