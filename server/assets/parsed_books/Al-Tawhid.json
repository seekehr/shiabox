Verily, it is said to a thing that did no exist and then came into being: Since when did it exist? Verily, my Lord, the Blessed and Exalted, has always been Ever-Living, but not with quality. There is no time limit for Him. Nor is there any quality for His Existence. There is neither any space for Him. He is not in a thing or on anything. He has not created for His Being any space. He is not strengthened after crating anything. Nor was He weak before creating anything. He was not frightened before He originated anything. None of the created things are like Him. He was not powerless over the things before their creation. Nor will He be powerless over them after they have gone. He has always been Ever-Living without an accidental existence. He was the Omnipotent Sovereign before creating anything, and He was the Supreme Sovereign after having brought it into existence. There is no quality for His Essence, nor is there space for Him. He does not have any limit. He is not recognized by a thing that may be His like. He does not age. He does not shout to call anything. Nothing frightens Him. All things become stunned from His Fear. He is Ever-Living, but not a blank living, nor a depicted existence. He neither has a restricted quality, nor an effect that follows up, nor a place that adjoins a thing, but He is the Ever-Living who knows everything, and the Sovereign who always has Omnipotence and Sovereignty. He created what He willed, and He willed with His Will. He is not limited. He has no parts. And He does not perish. He is the First without any quality, and the Last without any space. Everything is Command. Blessed is the Lord of the worlds! Woe be upon you, O questioner! Verily, my Lord cannot be conceived by imagination. Uncertainties do not befall Him. He does not adjoin anything, nor does anything adjoin Him. Incidents do not occur to Him. He is not questioned about anything He does, nor is He places on anything. Slumber does not seize Him, nor does sleep; to Him belongs whatsoever is in the Heavens, whatsoever is in the Earth, whatsoever is between them and whatsoever is below the ground.\"",

Inform me about when our grandfather the Messenger of Allah (SA) ascended to heaven to meet His Lord, the Mighty and High, and He commanded him to complete fifty daily prayers. Why did he not ask for any relief for his Ummah, until Musa son of Imran (AS) said to him to go back to his Lord and ask for relief as your Ummah does not have the strength for that? Thus, he (AS) answered, O son! Verily, the Messenger of Allah (SA) was not going to suggest anything to his Lord, the Mighty and High, nor reconsider anything He had commanded him to so. Therefore, when Musa (AS) asked him to do so, he had interceded for his Ummah to the Prophet (SA); it did not suffice for him to reject the intercession of his brother Musa (AS). So he (SA) returned to his Lord, the Mighty and High, and asked him for relief until He lowered the obligation to five daily prayers. He says, I then asked: \"O father! Then why did he not return to his Lord, the Mighty and High, and ask Him for relief from five daily prayers?\" He (AS) therefore, replied, O son! He (SA) intended to relieve his Ummah by means of the word of Allah, the Mighty and High: \"Whoever brings a good deed, he shall have ten like it.\" Do you not see that when he (SA) descended to the Earth, Jibrail (AS) revealed to him: \"O Muhammad! Verily, your Lord sends you His Greetings, and says: They are five for fifty, My word shall not be changed, nor am I in the least unjust to the servants.\" He says: then I asked, \"O father! Did Allah, the Exalted, not mention that He cannot be described in terms of space?\" So he (AS) responded, \"Of course, exalted is Allah from that.\" Therefore, I asked, \"Then what is the meaning of the word of Musa(AS) to the Messenger of Allah (SA): Go back to your Lord?'\" Thus, he (AS) replied, The meaning of this is the same as the Word of Ibrahim (AS): Surely I fly to my Lord; He will guide me, and the word of Musa (AS): And I hastened on to Thee, my Lord, that Thou might be pleased, and His Word, the Mighty and High: Therefore fly to Allah. This means pilgrimage to the House of Allah. O son! Verily, the Kabah is House of Allah; therefore, whoever makes pilgrimage to the House of Allah ahs endeavored to reach Allah. The mosque are House of Allah; therefore, whoever proceeds to them has proceeded to Allah, and endeavored to visit Him. The praying person, so long as he is prayer, is standing before Allah, Lofty be His Majesty. The people staying in the planes of Arafat are standing before Allah, the Mighty and High. Verily, for Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, are places in His Heavens, whoever is ascended to them is ascended to Him. Do you not hear Allah, the Mighty and High, that To Him ascend the angels and the Spirit, and He, the Mighty and High, says: To Him do ascend the good words: and the good deeds, lift them up.",

Whoever enters My Fortress is safe from My Chastisement.\" When the camel passed by, he (AS) called out to us, \"That is subject to conditions. And I am among its conditions.\"\nThe Compiler of this book explains: Among the conditions (of the statement; there is no god but Allah) is the acknowledgment that Al-Rida (AS) is an Imam appointed by Allah, the Mighty and High, over the people [ibad], and the one to whom obedience is due.",

Abu Nasr Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Tamim al-Sarkhasi said: Hariz on the authority of Abd al-Aziz, on the authority of Zayd ibn Wahb, on the authority of Abu Dharr (may Allah have mercy upon him) that I went out one night.\nThe Messenger of Allah (SA) was all alone. I thought that he was averse to anyone walking with him. When I started walking in the moonlight, he turned around and saw me. He enquired, \"What is that?\" I answered, \"Abu Dharr. May Allah make me your ransom!\" He (SA) said: \"Come here, O Abu Dharr!\" So I walked with him for some time. He said: Verily, the ones with much will be the ones with less. On the Day of Resurrection with the exception of those Allah has favoured. His Favour will spread to them from right to left, and from front to back. It will fill them with good.\nAbu Dharr says: I continued to walk with him for a while. Then he (SA) said: \"Sit down here. He made me sit down in some low ground around which was stones.\" He said to me, \"Sit down until I return to you.\" He (Abu Dharr) said: He went to a stony area until I could no longer see him. His delay was prolonged. Then I heard him coming, while saying, \"Even if he fornicated and eve if he stole?\" He said: When he came back, I immediately asked him, \"O Prophet of Allah! May Allah make me your ransom! Who are you talking to in the stony area for I did not hear anyone answer you?\" He replied, \"It was Jibra'il who appeared to me in that stony area and said: Glad tidings to your Ummah that anyone who dies without associating anything with Allah, the Mighty and High, will enter Heaven.\" He (SA) added, \"I asked Jibra'il: Even if he fornicated and even if he stole?' He replied: Yes, and even if he drank wine.'\"\nThe Compiler of this book says: What he means by this is that he will succeed in repentance so that he may enter Paradise.",

Verily, you have a Lord who is your Creator. O Allah! Forgive me!' Then Allah, the Mighty and High, looks down upon him with mercy, and forgives him.\nThe Compiler of this book says: Allah, the Mighty and High, has already said: Or look they not into the Kingdom of the Heavens and the Earth and whatever things Allah created. What is meant by this is either: Have they not contemplated the Kingdom of the Heaven and the Earth, and the wonders of their creation?' or Have they not contemplated these things like people of reason, and reflected upon them?' If they did, they would know that Allah, the Mighty and High, made the Heavens and the Earth with greatness: they are supported without pillars, and they are tranquilized without any tool.\nHe created the Heavens and the Earth so that people could ponder upon their Creator, their Master, and their Manager. He created them so that people would know that He does not resemble anything, including what the unbelievers have taken as gods other than Allah, the Mighty and High. Matter does not have to power to hold the tiniest of particles in air without a pillar or tool Through such comparisons people recognize that Allah is the Creator of the Heavens, the Earth, and of all bodies. They also recognize that nothing in Allah's Realm or Kingdom resembles Him.\nHe is the Owner of the Heavens and the Earth. It is He who has power over them. He has created the Heavens and the Earth so that people can contemplate them and witness that they are the creations of Allah, the Mighty and High. In so doing, they realize that Allah, the Mighty and High, is their Master. They realize that Allah has power over them since they form part of His Belongings, and His Creation. They are part and parcel of His Omnipotence, Authority, and Ownership.\nIt is through the vision of the Heavens and the Earth, and the creation of Allah, that people realize that Allah has power over them since Allah, the Mighty, and High, does not create but what He owns, and what He has power over. His Word: And whatever things Allah created,1 refer to various types of creation. Through introspection, people can reason that since Allah is their Creator, He is more worth of Lordship than the recently created celestial bodies.",

My father (RA) said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said: Ahmad ibn Abu Abd Allah on the authority of his father Muhammad Khalid Barqi; on the authority of Ahmad ibn Nadr and others; on the authority fo Amr ibn Thabit; on the authority of a man who he named on the authority of Abu Ishaq Safii; on the authority of al-Harith al -Awar who said\nOne day, the Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) gave a sermon after Asr (afternoon) prayer. The people were astonished by the beautiful words with which he praised Allah, Exalted be His Majesty.\nAbu Ishaq said: I asked Harith, \"Did you not memorize it?\" He answered, \"I wrote it down.\" So he dictated it to us from his script:\nAll praise belongs to Allah for Who does not die, and Whose wonders shall never come to an end. He exercises His (Universal) Power everyday, creating things that did not exist before; Who does not beget any who could claim to share in His Glory and Might; and Who is not begotten to die so that He could leave an heir behind. He is beyond all imagination; hence, He cannot be regarded as a visible shape.\nHe is too far beyond the reach of sight to leave any mental impression of Him. His Beginning has no beginning, and His End has no end. Time does not outlast Him. Excess and loss cannot affect Him. He cannot be described in terms of when, what and where. He is Hidden among the hidden. He is Manifest in the mind through His Signs, and through His Wisdom in His Creation.\nWhen questioned about Him, the prophets did not describe Him in terms of any limit, scope, extent or in terms of constituents. Rather, they described Him in terms of His Functions, and they led people towards Him through His Signs. The minds of the intellectuals do not dare deny His Existence. There can be no denying the Might of the Creator of the heavens and the Earth, and all that is between them. He is totally distinct from His Creation. Nothing resembles Him. He brought His Creation into existence so that He would be obeyed and worshipped. He gave human beings the strength to serve Him, and he rebutted their excuses through the best of arguments.\nThus, whoever meets his doom does so knowingly and justifiably. It is through His Grace that redemption is secured by the redeemed, and it is Allah's Grace that prevails in this life and the life to come. Then, Allah to Whom all praise is due, inaugurated the function of this worldly life with His Own Praise, and wound up the function of this worldly life, and the next life, whit His Own Praise. As He Himself says: And judgment shall be given between them with justice, and it shall be said: All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.\nAll praise is due to Allah Who, despite having no body, has adorned Himself with the Robes of Greatness and Grandeur, and has covered Himself with the Mantle of Awe and Reverence, without having any corporal form. He occupies the Celestial Throne unceasingly. He is far above His Creation, without being far, and without being in mutual contact with them. Neither has He any limit which may end in any limit, nor is there anything like Him through which He can be recognized.\nWhoever claims to be holy, except Him, is bound to be humiliated. Whoever magnifies himself is bound to be humbled. All thins bow before His Greatness and are obedient to His Lordship and Might. The function of the eyes becomes tired in searching for Him. The imagination is unable to reach His Attributes. He existed before any beginning, and nothing preceded Him. He is the Last of All, and there is no last for Him at all. With His Might He holds sway over all things. He observes all places without making any movement. No touch can ever touch Him nor can any sense ever sense Him. And He it is Who is Allah in Heavens and Allah in the Earth; and He is the Wise, the knowing.1\nWhatever He intended to create He planned for it soundly and correctly without there being any example of it before, and without being tired thereby (in creating whatever He wanted to create). He started whatever He needed to start, and made whatever He wanted to make. He intended to create two weights, the jinn and humankind, so that they should recognize His Lordship on the basis of all these means (of revealed wisdom in His Creation referred to above), and be able to obey Him (consciously).\nWe glorify Allah with all words of praise for the bounties He has bestowed. And we seek guidance from Him in our righteous affairs. Furthermore, we seek refuge from Him against our misdeeds. We solicit His Forgiveness for our past sins. We bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad (SA) in His Servant and Messenger whom Allah raised with truth, who leads to Allah, and who guides towards Him.\nThus, He rescued us from misguidance through him, guiding us to the right path, and through him freed us from ignorance. Hence, whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, he indeed achieves a mighty success,2 and has secured divine blessings in abundance. And whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger surely suffers a manifest loss, and deserves a humbling chastisement.\nHence, strive to listen, obey counsel with sincerity, and share the burden with others effectively and gracefully. Help yourself by sticking to the right path, and in avoiding wicked deeds. Give to others what is right, and take from others what is right. Cooperate with me (the Imam) by means of these tasks. Seize the idiotic oppressor, tie him, and bind him. Promote the good, and prohibit the evil. Learn to appreciate the worth of illustrious people. May Allah keep us secure and steady on the right path, and keep us constant in abstaining from evil! I beg Allah for our forgiveness!",

"Content": "2. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (May Allah be pleased with him) said:\nMuhammad ibn Amr al-Katib, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ziyad al-Qalzumi, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Abu Ziyad al-Jiddi, the one who lead the prayers at Jiddah, that Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Umar ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) related to me that I heard Abu al-Hasan al-Rida (AS) say this about the Unity (of Allah) in the presence of alMamum, Ibn Abu Ziyad said: their freed slave and maternal uncle to some of them, Ahmad ibn Abd Allah al- Alawi also related it to me, on the authority of al-Qasim ibn Ayyub al- Alawi that\nWhen al-Mamum wanted to appoint al-Rida (AS) to the Caliphate, he gathered the Hashimites and said: I want to appoint al-Rida as the Caliph after me.\nThe Hashimites envied him because of this and said: \"Are you going to hand over political and religious authority to an ignorant man who has no idea of how to run the Caliphate? Have him summoned before us so that you can see his ignorance, and then you can judge what we affirm.\"\nTherefore, he sent someone to summon him. The Hashimites said to him (AS): \"O Abu al-Hasan! Go up to the pulpit, and give us an example of how we should serve Allah.\"\nHence he (AS) climbed up the pulpit, sat down, and lowered his head for some time without saying anything. He (AS) then rose up, stood up straight, praised Allah and extolled Him, and sent blessings on the Prophet and his Household (AS).\nHe (AS) then said:\nThe best of service is to acknowledge the existence of Allah. The foundation of acknowledgement of Allah is to process His unity. Allah's Unity is established through the denial of descriptions, since all intellects bear witness that descriptions are created, and whatever is created requires a Creator, who is neither identifier or identified. Every identifier and identified is connected, and connection is evidence of occurrence.\nWhatever occurs cannot be eternal. Hence, anyone who describes Allah in anthropomorphic terms has not described Allah's Essence. Furthermore, anyone who describes Allah by means of reason has not described Him. Anyone who equates Him with anything has not described the Reality. Anyone who limits Allah has not recognized Him. Anyone who seeks to point Him out has not approached Him. Anyone who describes Allah in human terms has not described Him. Anyone who divides Allah into parts has not drawn near Him. And anyone who imagines Allah has intended other than Him.\nEverything which is known is in itself created. Every existence other than Him is caused. The existence of Allah is inferred through His Creation. The existence of Allah is acknowledged by means of the intellect. The existence of Allah is proven through nature. Allah placed the creation as a veil between the Creator and the created. Allah differs from creation by means of His Distinction. He gave a beginning to everything so that everything would know that He ha no beginning, and so that everything would know that those who have a beginning are incapable of giving a beginning to others. He gave movement to everything so that everything would know that He is devoid of movement, because movement is a manifestation of need.\nHis Names are interpretations. His Actions are instructions. His Essence is a fact. The Core of His Essence is a distinction between Him and His Creation. And His Elapses [ghubur] are limitations for all but Him. Verily, whoever describes Allah is ignorant of Him. Anyone who attempts to encompass Him has totally missed Him. And anyone who thinks that He can be grasped in His Entirety has totally mistaken Him.\nAnyone who asks, \"How is He?\" has compared Him. Anyone who asks, \"Why does He exist?\" implies that He is caused. Anyone who asks, \"How long has He existed?\" has subjected Him to the limits of time. He who asks, \"In what is He?\" implies that He is contained. He who asks, \"What is His Extent?\" has limited Him. He who asks, \"How far does He reach?\" has raised Him, and whoever raises Him, implies that He has a limit. Whoever gives Allah an extent implies that He has parts. Whoever claims that Allah has parts has described Him. Whoever describes Him has disbelieved in Him.\nAllah is not subject to change like creation is subject to change. In the same way, He is not limited like the limitations of the limited. He is One, but not in the sense of a number. He is Apparent, but not in the sense of pursuit. He is Evident, but not in the sense of sight. He is Hidden, but not in the sense of pursuit. He is Far, but not in the sense of distance. He is Near, but not in the sense of closeness. He is Subtle, but not in the sense that He has a body. He is Existent, but not in the sense that He comes from non-existence.\nHe is a Doer, but not by means of compulsion. He is the Appraiser, but not by means of thought. He is the Controller (of the Universe), buy not by means of movement. He is the One who Wills, but not by means of soliciting. He is the One who Wills, but not in the sense that He is eager. He is the Perceiver, but not by means of touch. He is All-Hearing, but not by means of any instrument. He is All-Seeing, but not by means of any tool.\nTime cannot be associated with Him. Space does not contain Him. Slumber does not seize Him. Attributes do not limit Him. Tools do not bind Him. His Essence supersedes time. His Existence supersedes non-existence. His Eternity supersedes beginning. By giving senses to other, He proves that He is devoid of sense. By creating substance, He proves that He is not a substance. By giving contrasts, He proves that He has no contrast. By establishing pairs in creation, He proves that He has not partner.\nLight is the opposite of darkness like certainty is the opposite of uncertainty. Dryness is the opposite of wetness as cold is the opposite of heat. By creating similarity, Allah points out that He is the Creator. By creating difference, Allah points out that He is the Differentiator. As the Might and High has said: And of everything We have created pairs that you may be mindful.1 Therefore, He differentiated between the prior and the subsequent to prove that nothing precedes Him, and that nothing succeeds Him.\nEverything that has an instinct bears witness that the One who gave them their instinct ha no instinct. Everything that is different bears witness that the One who made the different is devoid of differences. Everything that is subjected to time bears witness the One who subjected them to time is not subject to time. Everything that is veiled bears witness that the only veil which exists between them and the One who veiled them is themselves.\nAllah was Lord even when there were no subjects. He was the One and Only True God even when no creation existed. He was All-Knowing even when there was nothing to be known. He was the Creator even before the creation existed. He was the All-Hearing even when there was nothing to be heard. He did not earn the title of Creator merely because of creation. He did not earn the title of Creator merely because he gave the created a beginning.\nAnd how could it be otherwise when the conjunction since' [mudh] does not make Him obscure? The word may' [qad] does not approach Him. The expression perhaps' [laalla] does not veil Him. The conjunction when' [mata] does not set a time limit for Him. The expression at the time when' [hina] does not comprise Him. The word with' [maa] does not unite Him with anything. Verily, particles bind together, and tools point to things similar to themselves to show their effectiveness.\nThe conjunction since' prevents Him from being without beginning. The word may' prevents Him from being eternal. The conjuction if not' [law la] prevents Him from being Complete; thus indicating division.\nDifference is manifest through opposition, making its Creator evident to the intellect while being concealed fro sight. When Allah is imagined, other than Him is imagined. Difference points to Him. Through difference, verification is introduced, and through difference, the intellect confirms the belief in Allah Through verification faith is complete. There is no profession of faith without recognition, and no recognition without sincerity. There is no sincerity in anthropomorphism. And there is no negation (of Truth) through the affirmation of anthropomorphism.\nHence, whatever is found in creation is not found in the Creator, and whatever is possible in creation is impossible to the Creator. Motion and stillness do not occur in Him. And how can something He executed occur in Him? And how can something He originated return to Him? If this were the case, His Essence would have contrast, His Essential Being would be divided into parts, and He could not be called \"without beginning.\" And since the creator differs from the created, if He is restricted with the word behind' then He will be restricted with the word in front.' If you seek to complete Him, then you imply that He is deficient. How can He be Eternal if it is implied that He has a beginning? How can He give existence if He has been created?\nIf any sign of creation exists in Him that would deny Him. If any sign of creation existed in Him, He would surely be subject to change. However, there is no evidence that He is subject to change. There are no answers to questions about Him. No reverence for Him can be found in meaning. There was no injustice in manifesting Himself to creation. The Eternal cannot be divided into \"two\" and the One without a Beginning cannot have a beginning. There is no god but Allah, the Greatest, and the Most High. Whoever gives partner to Allah is a liar, who is lead far astray, and who is in manifest loss. May Allah bless the Prophet Muhammad and His Noble and Pure Progeny!",

Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Muhammad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Kufi said; and (also) Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Zakariyya al-Qittan, on the authority of Bakr ibn Abd Allah ibn Habib, on the authority of Tamim ibn Buhlul, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu Muawiyah, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Abd al-Rahman, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu Abd Allah (AS) on the authority of his father, on the authority of his grandfather (AS) that\nThe Commander of the Faithful (AS) roused the people to was with Muawiyah for the second time. When the people gathered around him, he stood up and addressed them in the following terms:\nAll praise be to Allah, the One and Only who is sought by all, the Unique and the One Who was not created out of anything nor created anything out of pre-existing matter. On the contrary, He created everything through His Might which is manifest in all things. And verily, everything came into existence because of Him. He has no attribute which can be comprehended, nor has He any limit which can be established. In linguistic embellishment, the tongue is crippled when it comes to describing His Attributes. And circumlocution with respect to His Attributes leads to a blind alley. The sharpest of intellects are unable to comprehend His Kingdom. All comprehensive explanation is rendered ineffective in delving deep into His Kingdom. Unseen veils impede even the lowest level of understanding of His Hidden Knowledge. The keenest insights are at a loss when attempting to comprehend the most superficial layer of His Subtleties.\nThus, hallowed be Allah who can neither be reached by the most intrepid intellect nor conceived by the deepest insight. Exalted be He who is not subject to time, length, or limit. Purified be He whose Beginning has not beginning, whose End has no end, and who will never be annihilated. Glorified be He! He is as He has described Himself, and the describers cannot reach His Descriptions. He delineated the boundaries of all things at the time of their creation, and completely eradicated the possibility of Him resembling things or of things resembling Him. He cannot be contained by things which could describe Him. He has never been separate from things that can describe Him. He has never bin distant from things which could raise questions as to His whereabouts.\nRather, He, the Glorified, has encompassed all the things through His Knowledge, strengthened them, and enumerated them in His Memory. Nothing is hidden from Him behind the veils of the atmosphere, the deep slumber which occurs in darkness, and whatever exists in the highest Heavens, and the lowest Earth. Everything that exists has a custodian and a keeper. All things are surrounded by other things. And He encompasses them all.\nHe is the One, the Unique, and the Besought. He is not subject to time. He does not tire from creating thins. Whatever He willed, He said: \"Be\" and it was. He created everything without precedent, without fatigue, and without planning. Anything which makes something makes it out of something. Allah, however, made His Creation out of nothing.\nEvery scholar acquired knowledge after being ignorant while Allah was never ignorant, and never acquired knowledge. He encompassed all things through His Knowledge even before they were created. Hence, His Knowledge did not increase through their creation. After they came into existence, He knew as much about them as He knew before they came into existence. He never created anything to strengthen His Control. He never created anything out of fear of decay or loss. He never created anything to oppose an adversary. He never created anything to match an equal. He never created anything to become the equal of a dominating partner.\nHe never did anything of the like because all of creation is nurtured by Him, and all things that exist are His Humble Slaves and Servants.\nGlorified be He who never feels weary from creating, and sustaining. And glorified be He who was not prevented from creating more out of inability or laziness. He knew what He created, and created what He knew. Whatever He created was not the result of deliberation or based on new knowledge. Nor does any doubt arise in Him regarding the things He has not created. What He created, and what He did not create, was the result of His Inviolable Decision. His Firm Knowledge, and His Exact Command.\nHe made Himself Unique in His Lordship, and Specific in (His) Oneness. He earmarked glory and praise for Himself, made Himself Peerless in Unity, Grandeur and Sublimity. He remains Matchless in Praise, and Exalted in His Glory. He is far above parenthood. And he is purified and sanctified against the feminine touch (i.e. sexual relations). He is far too Great and too Mighty to seek the proximity of any participant. Thus, nothing He has created can oppose Him. There is no equal to Him in His Possessions, and there is no partner for Him in His Kingdom.\nHe is the One, the Unique, and the Besought of all. He is the Eternal, the Everlasting, and the Lord of Space. He has always been, and always will be. He is Unique in Eternity. He existed before time and will exist after the end of all affairs. He will never come to an end nor be exhausted.\nThis is how I describe my Lord. Thus, there is no god but Allah. He is the Greatest of the Great. Glorified and Exalted be He. He is the Mightiest of the Mighty. He is far, far, above what the unjust claim about Him.\nAnd Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Saqar al-Saigh also said this sermon that Muhammad ibn al-Abbas ibn Bassam said: Abu Zayd Said ibn Muhammad al-Basri related to me that Umrah bint Aws related to me that My grandfather al-Husayn ibn Abd al-Rahman related to me on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu Ad Allah Ja''far ibn Muhammad (AS), on the authority of his father on the authority of his grandfather (AS) that the Commander of the Faithful (AS) addressed this sermon when he roused the people to the war with Muawiyah for the second time.",

He is the Great Absolute with Grandeur and Might. He innovated what He instigated. And He originated what He created without example prior to creating anything. The One without a Beginning raised us through the benevolence of His Lordship. With His knowledge He rendered. Due to the judgment of His Omnipotence He created all of creation. With the light of morning He made the dawn. Therefore, there is no substitute for His Creation, and none can modify what He makes. There is no hastening his Judgement, and no resting from His Call.\nThere is no decline to His Realm, not an interruption to His Time. He is the First Existence, and is Forever Permanent. He is covered by His light, not by His Creation, in the high-aspiring horizon, the lofty might, and the high realm. He is far from everything, yet He is close to everything. Hence, He is Evident to His creation without being seen. He is the Highest Prospect. He liked to be qualified with Oneness so He covered Himself with His own Light. He is Distinctive in His Sublimity, and is Hidden from His Creation.\nHe sent Messengers to His Creation as His Decisive Argument and Witnesses over them. Between the Messengers, He sent Prophets to His Creation, to give glad tidings (to the believers) who would be granted eternal life after having received the Evidence from Allah. He also sent Prophets to His Creation as warners of impeding doom to those who would be destroyed after having received the Evidence (from Allah). He did all of this so that servants may know their Lord. As a result, they recognized His Lordship after having denied it. They professed the Unity of His Divinity as a result of Diving Guidance.",

Allah honors you by them.\" The Prophet (SA) enquired, \"What are they, O Jibra'il?\" He said: Say: O One who reveals beauty, and hides ugliness! O One who does not punish the offender, and who does not ear the veil (from sins)! O Most Great in pardoning! O Best of the Overlookers! O All-Embracing in Forgiveness! O One who Opens His Hands in Mercy! O Hearer of all Whispers! O One whom all complaints are made! (O Last Resort of the Fallen!). O Noble One! O Possessor of Great Favor! O One who Blessed before anyone deserves it! O our Lord! O our Master! O our Guardian! O Goal of our Desires! I beseech You, O Allah, not to make me ugly by means of the Fire. The Messenger of Allah (SA) asked, \"O Jibra'il! What are the virtues of these words?\" Jibra'il replied, So great! So great! The virtues of these words are impossible to describe. Even if the angels from the seven heavens and the seven earths joined together to describe the virtues of these words until the Day of Judgment, they would not be able to describe even a thousandth part of them. Therefore, when a man says: \"O One who reveals beauty, and hides ugliness,\" Allah covers him up with His Mercy in this world, and makes him beautiful in the Hereafter.

And when he says: \"O Most Great in Pardoning,\" Allah will forgive his sins even if they are as much as the foam from the sea. When he says: \"O Best of the Overlookers,\" Allah will forgive him even sins such as theft, drinking wine, worldly frights, and other major sins. And when he says: \"O All-Embracing in Forgiveness,\" Allah, the Mighty and High, will open seventy gates of Mercy to him in a way that he will be overwhelmed by Allah, the Mighty and High's Mercy till he parts this world. When he says: \"O One who Opens His Hands in Mercy,\" Allah opens His Hands of Mercy to him. And when he says: \"O Hearer of all Whispers, O One to who all Complaints are made,\" Allah will bestow upon him the reward of every afflicted, unaffiliated, sick, blind, destitute, and poor person till the Day of Judgment. When he says: \"O Noble One,\" Allah will make him noble like the prophets. When he says: \"O Possessor of Great Favor,\" Allah will bestow upon him His Protection, and the protection of the created on the Day of Judgment. And when he says: \"O One who gives blessings before anyone deserves it,\" Allah will grant him rewards equal to the number of those who thanked Him for His Blessings. When he says: \"O our Lord, O our Master,\" Allah will say: \"My angels! Bear witness that I forgave him, and I will give him rewards similar to the numbers of those who are in Paradise, and Hell, the seven heavens and the seven earths, the sun, the moon, the stars, rain drops, creatures, mountains, pebbles, soil, and other than these, as well as the Empyrean and the Throne.

Then he stood up, with his\r\nface flushed, and addressed the congregation as such:\r\nAll praise be to Allah for Whom refusal to give does not enrich, and for Whom\r\nmunificence does not make poor! All who give lose, expect He. He is full of\r\nbeneficial bounties and plentiful gifts. All of creation depends on His Generosity for\r\ntheir sustenance. He has prepared the way for those who seek Him. He is as\r\nGenerous when He is asked, as He is when He is not asked. Time does not affect\r\nHim as this would imply that He is subject to change.\r\nHis Essence would not be affected, and His Wealth would not be diminished, even if\r\nHe gave away all of the silver and all of the gold found in the mines in the\r\nmountains, and all of the pearls which the shells of the ocean produce for His\r\nServants. His Wealth would remain great and unaffected, even if He answered the\r\ndemands of every beggar because He is the Most Generous. Giving does not\r\ndecrease His Wealth, not do the request of His Supplicants make Him miserly. His\r\nCommand, when He intends anything, is only to say to it: Be, so it is.1\r\nThe Angels are incapable of approaching the nobility of His Throne. They are\r\nconfused when they attempt to understand Him and the greatness of His Might and\r\nMajesty. Although they are close to His Realm, they know nothing about His Affair\r\nexcept what He informs them. They are so close to the sanctity of His Realm, that\r\nthey recognize the limitations with which they were created saying: Glory be to\r\nThee! We have no knowledge but that which Thou hast taught us; surely Thou art\r\nthe Knowing, the Wise.2\r\n1\r\n2\r\nTranslator's Note: Quran: 36:82.\r\nTranslator's Note: Quran: 2:32\r\n\r\n42\r\n\r\nThen what is your opinion, O questioner, about the One I have described in such\r\nterms? Praise and glory be to Him. He has no beginning, and is not subject to\r\nchange. His Essence does not change states. Long stretches of day and night have\r\nno affect on Him. He originated the creation without any example which He could\r\nfollow, and without any specimen prepared by any deity that was before Him.\r\nAttributes do no encompass Him so that we can comprehend Him, much less\r\ncomprehend Him by means of limitations. He is Still. There is nothing whatsoever\r\nlike unto Him. Exalted is He from the attributes of the created. Eyes cannot perceive\r\nHim so that He may be described by sight. His Essence is only known to Himself\r\nand cannot be recognized by His Creation. His Greatness surpasses the greatest\r\nconjectures of the most imaginative. He is Higher than anything that could be\r\nconceived by the feeble minds who seek to understand His Inner Greatness.\r\nHe does not have a likeness. Nothing He creates is similar to Him. To the ones that\r\nrecognize Him, He is above compeers and opponents. The ones who give partners\r\nto Allah are liars as they compare Him to their own kind. They embellish Him\r\nthrough their imaginations with the ornaments of creation. They divided Him in\r\nparts through speculation. They use their intellects to assess Him on the basis of\r\ncreation, giving Him different strengths. How can this be done when it is impossible\r\nfor the intellect to measure His Extent?\r\nMisleading dreams have gone astray in perceiving His Essence; because He is\r\nhigher than the limits of human reasoning. Even the Angels, who are close to His\r\nRealm of Glory, cannot encompass Him. Exalted is He from having a parallel with\r\nwhich He may be resembled.\r\nHe is the Subtle [al-Latif]. He prevents the imagination from finding Him in the depth\r\nof His Realm. He prevents the minds which are free from evil thoughts from\r\ncomprehending His Being. He prevents the hearts who long to embrace His\r\nAttributes from going beyond description, and securing knowledge of His Divinity.\r\nHe turns back those who cross the dark pitfalls of the unknown in their search for\r\nHim. Glorified be He!\r\nAll those who seek to comprehend him return defeated, admitting that His\r\nKnowledge cannot be understood through such random efforts. They admit that not\r\nan iota of His Honor can enter the intellect of the greatest thinkers. They admit that\r\nHe is far from the most powerful strengths of limited beings because He is other\r\nthan His Creation. Therefore, He has no peer in His Creation. Verily, things are\r\ncompared to their equal. However, if something has no equal, how can it be\r\ncompared with something which is completely different from it?\r\nHe is the Originator who had nothing before Him, and He is the Last who has\r\nnothing after Him. Eyes cannot perceive Him due to the magnificence of His Power.\r\nEyes are concealed with veils, and cannot penetrate their density. Eyes cannot\r\npenetrate the Veils of the Possessor of the Throne, and they cannot reach the One\r\nwho Governs Everything through His Will. The pride of all tyrants cringes except\r\nthe Majesty of His Greatness. All slaves surrender to Him, and all faces fear His Wrath.\r\nThe signs of His Wisdom are apparent from everything He has created. Everything\r\nHe created is His Proof, and is linked to Him. It is a silent creation, it is His Proof that\r\nspeaks through planning. He has fixed limits for everything He has created and has\r\nset everything firm. He has put everything in its place through the gracefulness of\r\nHis Planning.\r\nHe has fixed the direction for everything. Nothing surpasses or falls shorts of the\r\nposition He has willed. Nothing disobeys His Command to move, when He intends\r\nit to move. He does so without effort, and without challenge to His Order. Thus was\r\ncompleted the creation, and it bowed in obedience to Him. It was time for His\r\ncreation to respond to Him. The laziness of any slug or the inertness of any excusefinder did not prevent them from doing so.\r\nSo He straightened the curves of things, and completed the traces of their limits.\r\nWith His Power He created coherence n their contradictory parts, and joined\r\ntogether the factors of similarity. Then He distinguished their colors, and separated\r\nthem in varieties which differ in quantities, properties, and shapes. All of this was a\r\nnew creation. He made them firm, shaped them as He intended, and invented them.\r\nThrough His Knowledge He organized everything into species. His Planning\r\nperceives the splendor of its destiny.\r\nO questioner! Know that he who describes our Sublime Lord by means of limbs and\r\nextremities knows nothing about His Nature. Verily, his heart did not profess with\r\ncertainty that He is devoid of partners. It is as though he has not heard people\r\nrenouncing their false gods by saying: By Allah! We were certainly in manifest error,\r\nwhen we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds.1\r\nWhoever equates our Lord with anything has given Him a partner. Whoever gives\r\nHim a partner is an unbeliever as is stated in His Unambiguous verses, and as is\r\nindicated by His Clear Arguments. This is because Allah cannot be conceived by\r\nthe limits of human intelligence. If He could be, He would be subject to change. Nor\r\ncan Allah be conceived by means of intellectual efforts. If He could be, he would be\r\nlimited, and an object subject t alteration.\r\nHe is the Producer [al-Munshi'] who created everything without a need for\r\nimagination, without the urge of a hidden impulse, without any past experiment, and\r\nwithout the assistance of any partner who may have helped Him in creating\r\nwonderful things.\r\nThose who compare Him to His Creation divided Him into parts: some are limited,\r\nsome vary in size, and others fall into different categories. He, the Mighty and High,\r\nExists on His Own Accord, and is not dependent. People have not honored Him with\r\nthe honor that He deserves.\r\nIn order to demonstrate that He cannot be compared to His Creation, that He has no\r\nequals, and that He is far above the analogies of the unbelievers who give him\r\nlimitations, He said: Any they have not honored Allah with the honor that is due to\r\nHim; and the whole Earth shall be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and\r\nheavens rolled up in His right hand; glory be to Him, and may He be exalted above\r\nwhat they associate (with Him).2\r\nWhen describing Allah, limit your selves to the Divine Attributes which the Quran\r\nhas provided, and seek light from the effulgence of its guidance. Leave to Allah that\r\nknowledge which Satan has prompted you to seek, and which neither the Quran\r\nenjoins you to seek, nor is there any trace of it in the actions or sayings of the\r\nProphet and other Imams of Guidance. This is the extreme limit of Allah's claim\r\nupon you.\r\nKnow that those who are firm in knowledge refrain from opening through the veils of\r\nthe unseen. The firm in knowledge, acknowledge their ignorance, and refuse to seek\r\njustification for their belief by means of the unseen. Hence, they say: We believe in\r\nit, it is all from our Lord.3 Allah, the Mighty and High praises them for admitting that\r\nthey cannot obtain forbidden knowledge. They do not engage in deep discussions\r\nregarding the knowledge which is hidden from them and remain firm in their faith.\r\nBe content with this, and do not limit the Greatness of Allah on the basis of the\r\nlimits of your own intelligence; otherwise, you will be destroyed.",

Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\r\nMuhammad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Kufi said: Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Barmaki said: Ali\r\nibn al-Abbas related to me that Jafar ibn Muhammad al-Ashari related to me, on the\r\nauthority of Fath ibn Yazid al-Jurjani that\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Abu Al-Hasan (Ali) al-Rida (AS) asking him about Divine Unity. Therefore, he\r\nreplied to me in his own writing.\r\nJafar says: Verily, Fath took out the letter for me so I read it myself in Abu al-Hasan's\r\n(AS) writing:\r\nIn the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. All praise be to Allah,\r\nwho gave human beings a natural predisposition to recognize their Lord and to praise\r\nHim. Allah guides humankind towards Himself through His Creation, and who proves\r\nthat He is Eternal by bringing creatures into existence. He has made them resemble\r\neach other to prove that there is nothing that resembles Him. He has made His Signs as\r\nwitnesses to His Might.\r\nHis Essence is independent from His Attributes. Eyes are prevented from seeing Him.\r\nImagination is incapable of encompassing Him. There is no duration for His Being, nor\r\nis there any limit for His Continuation. Human senses do not encompass Him.\r\nNo screen (of non-understandability) can conceive Him. The only screen between the\r\nCreator and the created is creation itself. The reason why the created have been\r\nscreened from the Creator is to prevent the created from conceiving of their Creator in\r\nterms which are unworthy. This is because the adjectives which apply to the created\r\nare not suitable for the Creator.\r\nThe other reason (that Allah cannot be understood) is that there is a world of difference\r\nbetween the Creator and the created, the Sustainer and the sustained (the Ruler and the\r\nruled), and the Confiner and the confined. He is One, but not in a numerical sense. He is\r\nthe Creator, but not in the sense of movement or action. He is the All-Hearing, but not\r\nthrough any auditory organ. And He is the All-Seeing, but not by visual means.\r\nHe is a Witness, but without mutual contact. He is Manifest, but not in the sense of\r\nbeing distant. He is Hidden, but not in the sense of being behind a curtain. He is\r\nApparent, but not in the sense of being in front of anything. Penetrating eyes have\r\ncalled miserable trying to perceive the truth about Him. His Existence dwarfs and\r\ncripples the imagination (in its attempt to grasp Him).\r\nThe first step in accepting faith is acknowledging the existence of Allah. And the most\r\nperfect way of acknowledging Him lies in recognizing His Unity. And the peak of His\r\nUnity lies in negating that His Attributes are part of His Essence, since attributes are\r\nseparate from the entity they describe in the same way that the entity is independent of\r\nand separate from the attributes which describe it. If united, the entity and its attributes\r\nproduce plurality (as opposed to unity).\r\nPlurality nullifies eternity. Hence, whoever ascribes attributes to Allah has actually\r\nmeasure Him. And whoever measures Him has actually nullified His Eternity. Whoever\r\nasks how He is, seeks to describe and explain Him. Whoever asks what He is, actually\r\ninduces Him. Whoever asks where He is, actually vacates Him (from other places).\r\nWhoever asks how long He will exist, actually confines Him (to a limited time). He was\r\nthe Knower before there was anything to know. He was the Creator when there was no\r\ncreation. He was the Lord when there was nothing over which to rule. He was the One\r\nGod when there was nothing to serve. Such is a description of our Lord. And He is far\r\nabove what the narrators have said about Him.",

Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\r\nMuhammad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Kufi said: Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Barmaki said: alHusayn ibn al-Hasan ibn Burdah said: al- Abbas ibn Amr al-Fuqami said on the authority\r\nof Abu al-Qasim Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al- Alawi, on the authority of al-Fath ibn Yazid alJurjani that\r\n\r\n48\r\n\r\n49\r\n\r\n U \r\n\r\n    > \r\n\r\n     m \r\n\r\nI met him1 (AS) on my return from Mecca to Khurasan and he was going to Iraq. I\r\nheard him say that \"Whoever fears Allah is feared, and whoever obeys Allah is\r\nobeyed.\" So I politely went over to him and greeted him. Hence, he (AS) returned my\r\ngreetings and then added:\r\nO Fath, he who pleases the Creator does not consider the displeasure of the\r\ncreation. And he who displeases the Creator deserves that that displeasure of\r\ncreation overpowers him. Verily, the Creator can only be described by means of the\r\nattributes He has given Himself.\r\nAnd how could He be described when he made the senses incapable of conceiving\r\nHim, the concepts incapable of describing Him, and the eyes incapable of perceiving\r\nHim? He is far above the attributes of the attributers and the descriptions of the\r\ndescribers. He is distant in His Closeness and close in His Distance. Thus, He is\r\nnear in His Farness and Far in His Nearness.\r\nSince He created conditions, the question how' cannot apply to Him. He ionized\r\nspace; therefore, the question where' cannot apply to Him. IN doing so He is the\r\nInventor [Mubdi'] of conditions and space. O Fath! Everybody is nourished with\r\nfood except the Creator, the Sustainer. Verily, He created bodies, yet He has neither\r\nbody nor image. He does not have parts, not does He have an end. He does not\r\nincrease or decrease.\r\nHe is not composed of any substance that would be found in a body. He is the\r\nSubtle, the All-Knowing, the All-Listening, and the All-Hearing. He is the One, the\r\nUnique, and the Needless. He begets not, nor is He begotten, and there is nothing\r\nequal unto Him. He is the Producer of All things. He gave shape to all bodies and\r\nmade all images. IF it were as the anthropomorphist say, then the Creator could not\r\nbe distinguished from the created, the Sustainer from the sustained, or the\r\nOriginator from the originated. However, He is the Producer. He differs from created\r\nbodies, images and things in that He resembles nothing.\r\nI asked: \"if Allah is One and humankind is one, do they not resemble each other in\r\noneness?\"\r\nHence, he (AS) replied:\r\nYou have said something impossible. May Allah secure you! Verily, the resemblance\r\nis limited to meaning. Names are one, and they indicate what is named. When it is\r\nsaid that the human being is one, it means that he is one as opposed to two. But, in\r\nfact, the human being is not truly one because his body parts are different and his\r\ncolors are different. He is composed of many parts which are not the same. His\r\nblood is other than his flesh. His flesh is other than his blood. His nerves are other\r\nthan his veins. His hair is other than his skin. His darkness is other than his\r\npaleness. Likewise is the rest of creation. Thus, the human being in only \"one\" in\r\nname but not \"one\" in meaning.\r\nAllah, Exalted be His Majesty, is One and there is none other than Him. There is no\r\nvariation, contrast, increase, or decrease in Him. As for the human being, he is\r\ncreated from different parts and different substances. He is only \"one\" in\r\ncombination.\r\nI enquired: As for your statement regarding \"the Subtle,\" kindly explain it to me, I\r\nknow, of course, that His Subtlety differs from that of others. However, I would\r\nappreciate it if you could explain it to me in greater detail.\r\nTherefore, he (AS) answered:\r\nO Fath! I said: He is Subtle in subtleness of His Creation and in His Knowledge of\r\nmicroscopic matter. Do you not see His Stamp on the various types of plants, both\r\nsoft and rough? And do you not contemplate the subtle creation of creatures like the\r\ngnat and the mosquito and those insects which are even smaller than these two and\r\nare almost invisible to the naked eye? In fact, they are almost invisible due to their\r\ntiny size, making it virtually impossible to differentiate the male from the female, and\r\nthe young from the old.\r\nThus, when we see the smallness of creatures in their refinement, their instinct to\r\nreproduce, and their fear of death; when we see the creatures that exist in the\r\ndepths of the oceans, and in the branches of trees; when we see what exists in\r\ndeserts and wastelands, and that each species has a means of communication\r\nthrough which they are understood by their offspring; when we see how creatures\r\nfeed their offspring, and how creatures are distinguished by color, red with yellow,\r\nand white with red; then, and only then do we come to appreciate the subtlety of the\r\nCreator. Verily, everything has a precursor. Allah, the Creator, the Subtle, and the\r\nSublime created everything out of nothing.\r\nI asked: \"May I be your ransom! Is there a creator other than the Sublime Creator?\"\r\nHe (AS) replied:\r\nVerily, Allah, the Blessed and High says: Blessed be Allah, the best of creators.1 He\r\nhas certainly acknowledged that there are creators among His Servants, including\r\nJesus, the son of Mary [Isa ibn Maryam] (AS). He created from clay a figure of a bird\r\nby the will of Allah. Then he breathed into it, and it became a bird, by the will of\r\nAllah. And Samiri made for them the body of a calf that mooed.\r\nI enquired: \"Undoubtedly Isa created from clay a bird as a proof of his\r\nProphethood, while Samiri made the body of calf to refute Musa's (AS) Prophethood.\r\nWas that Allah's will? Certainly this is astonishing.\"\r\nHe answered:\r\nWoe unto you, O Fath! Verily, Allah has two intents or two wills; the definite [hatm]\r\nintent, and the determined [azm] intent. He forbids with desire, and orders without\r\ndesire. Have you not seen that He banned Adam (AS) and his wife from eating from\r\nthe tree while He wanted them to. Had he not willed it, they would not have eaten it,\r\nand if they had not eaten it, they would have defied Allah's will. He ordered Ibrahim\r\n(AS) to slaughter his son Ismail (AS) and desired him not to slaughter him. If He did\r\nnot will for him to slaughter him, then Ibrahim (AS) would have defied Allah's will,\r\nthe Mighty and High.\r\nI said: \"You have relieved me. May Allah relieve you! Except that you asked: The\r\nAll-Hearing and the All-Seeing, does He hear with an ear and see with an eye?\"\r\nConsequently, He (AS) replied:\r\nMost certainly He hears what He sees and sees what He hears. He sees, but not with\r\nan eye like the eyes of the created. He hears, but not like the listeners listen. He\r\nhears in the sense that nothing is hidden from Him, not even the movement of a\r\nblack particle on a hard rock in the dark of the night, in the depth of the Earth or in\r\nthe depth of the oceans. We say: He is Seeing but not like the created. And when He\r\ncomprehends all languages, and does not confuse one from another. We say: He\r\nhear, but not like others hear.\r\nI commented: \"May I be your ransom! I still have one last question.\"\r\nHe (AS) said: \"Proceed for the sake of Allah, for the good deeds of your father!\"\r\nI asked: \"Would He know the things that He has not made; that if He did make them,\r\nhow would they be?\"\r\nHe answered:\r\nWoe to you! Your questions are defiantly difficult. Have you not heard Allah say? If\r\nthere had been in them any gods except Allah, they would both have certainly been\r\nin a state of disorder.2 And His Word: And some of them would certainly have\r\noverpowered others.3 And He said relating an account of the people of Hell: Take us\r\nout; we will do good deeds other than those which we used to do.4 And He said: And\r\nif they were sent back, they would certainly go back to that which they are\r\nforbidden.5 He certainly knew what would have happened if other things had\r\nhappened.\r\nI then got up to kiss his hand and feet, but he (AS) brought his head nearer: hence I\r\nkissed his face and head. I left with so much contentment and joy that I am\r\nincapable of describing what was clarified for me of virtue and fortune.\r\nThe Compiler (may Allah have mercy on him) of this book says: Verily, Allah, the\r\nBlessed, the High, forbade Adam and his wife from eating from the tree while\r\n1\r\nTranslator's Note: This is the Eight Imam (AS) as is apparent from the fourteenth tradition.\r\n2\r\nTranslator's Note: Quran: 21:32.\r\n3\r\nTranslator's Note: Quran: 23:91.\r\n4\r\nTranslator's Note: Quran: 35:37.\r\n5\r\nTranslator's Note: Quran: 6:28.\r\n\r\n50\r\n\r\n1\r\nTranslator's Note: Quran: 23:14.\r\n\r\n51\r\n\r\nknowing that they would both eat from it. However He, the Mighty and High, decided\r\nthat He would not prevent them fro eating from the tree through determination [jabr]\r\nand power [qudrah], in the same fashion that He had prohibited them from eating by\r\norder and rebuke [zajr]. Thus, this is the meaning of His Will in these two case. If He,\r\nthe Mighty and High, prohibited fthem from eating by determination, and thenthey\r\nate from it, they would have defied His will, as al- `Alim1 (the Learned (AS) has said.\r\n\"Exalted is Allah, the Most High, from inability.",

The\r\ncreation of all things from nothing is a manifestation of His Omnipotence. The fleeting\r\nnature of all things ins a manifestation of His Permanence.\r\nAlthough no space is devoid of Him, He cannot be subjected to the question \"where?\"\r\nNothing is similar to Him so He cannot be described through similarity [kayfiyya].\r\nNeither is anything absent from His Knowledge so that He may know it through\r\ndistinction. He is Dissimilar to the attributes which He has brought about. He cannot be\r\ncomprehended by what He has created. He is beyond behavioral states due to His\r\nMagnificence and Exalted Nature. Limits are forbidden to Him in the brilliant acute\r\nmind's proficiencies. Enquiring minds cannot comprehend His Nature. Intellectual\r\nexplorers cannot conceive His Shape.\r\nDue to His Greatness, He cannot be confined to space. Due to His Majesty, He is\r\nbeyond measure. Due to His Magnificence, He cannot be divided. Imaginations cannot\r\ngrasp Him entirely. He cannot be comprehended by minds nor can He be compared.\r\nThe most eager of intellects cannot hope to comprehend Him through inference.\r\nOceans of Knowledge have dried up attempting to fathom Him. The sharpest minds of\r\nthe opponents have shriveled attempting to describe His Omnipotence.\r\nHe is One but not numbers; Everlasting, but not with an extent; and Existing, but\r\nwithout support. He is neither a genus so that the species may be compared to Him, nor\r\na shape so that the shapes may be compared to Him; nor like other things so that\r\ndescriptions may apply to Him. Intellects have floated away in the waves of His\r\nPerception. Imaginations are astonished when contemplating His Eternity. Intellects are\r\nprevented from understanding His Omnipotence. The minds have drowned in the\r\ndepths of the orbit of His Realm which possesses power over the bestowal of\r\nblessings, and which forbids with magnificence.\r\nHe is Sovereign over all thins. He never declines nor is encompassed by an attribute.\r\nThe obstinate fixed stars surrender to Him through their orbit. The firm causes submit\r\nto Him in the utmost heights of their section as a witness from all species over His\r\nLordship. The inability of beings bears witness to His Omnipotence. The coming into\r\nbeing of beings bear witness that He is without a beginning. And the death of beings\r\nbear witness that He is Everlasting.\r\nThus, there is no refuge for them from His Reach; there is no fleeing His Encirclement;\r\nthere is no hiding from His Decree; and there is no avoiding His Omnipotence. The\r\ncomposition of nature is proof. Creation out of nothing is proof that He has no\r\nbeginning. The creative power is sufficient as an admonition. Thus, there is no limit\r\nconnected to Him, no likeness of Him, and there is nothing hidden from Him. Exalted is\r\nHe, the Most High, from the attributes of created things!\r\nI bear witness that there is no god but Allah, with faith in His Lordship, and in contrast\r\nto those who deny Him. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His\r\nMessenger, the Inhabitant of the Best Resting Place, the Fruit of the Most Noble Lions\r\nand Purified Wombs, the Product of the Most Dignified Lineage and Best Birth place\r\nwhich is inaccessible to others and which has the most honorable foundation.\r\nHe was chosen by Allah as His trustworthy Friend from the Tree of Prophethood. The\r\ntree possesses fine wood, an upright trunk, high branches, blooming twigs, ripened\r\nfruits, and a precious interior. In nobility was the tree planted, and in sanctity it grew,\r\nbranching off, and producing honorable fruits. Hence, the tree was given prestige, and\r\nwas made lofty by the Prophet Muhammad (SA).\r\nEventually, Allah, the Mighty and High, honored him with the Trusted Spirit [al-Ruh alAmin],\r\nthe Open Light [al-Nur al-Mubin], and the Evident Book [al-Kitab al-Mustabin]. He\r\nmade Alboarak [buraq] subservient to Muhammad (SA) and the Angels greeted him.\r\nThe devils were frightened of him. Through him, Allah destroyed the idols, and the gods\r\nthat were served other than Him.\r\nHis practice [Sunnah] is sensible, his conduct [sirah] is just, and his judgment is true.\r\nHe complied with what his Lord ordered him, and fulfilled his responsibilities. He\r\nclearly preached Divine Unity, and made known to creation that there is no god but\r\nAllah, the One, the Only, who has not associates. Eventually, he purified the concept of\r\nDiving Unity, attributing all Lordship to Him.\r\nThrough Divine Unity, He made apparent his proof, and with Islam elevated his status.\r\nAllah, the Mighty and High, chose for His Prophet (SA) the spirit, the status, and the\r\nexpedition. May Allah bless him, and his Purified Progeny, as He has blessed all of the\r\nProphets who preceded him!",

Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Isam al-Kulayni (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\r\nMuhammad ibn Yaqub al-Kulayni said: Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Maan said: Muhammad ibn\r\nali ibn Atikah on the authority of al-Husayn ibn al-Nadr al-Fihri, on the authority of Amr alAwzaI, on the authority of Amr ibn Shimr, the authority of Jabir ibn Yazid al-Jufi, on the\r\nauthority of Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Ali al-Baqir (AS), on the authority of his father (AS)\r\nthat\r\n\r\n> \r\n\r\n59\r\n\r\nHis grandfather, Imam Ali, the Commander of the Faithful, delivered the following\r\nsermon seven days after the death of the Prophet (SA), after he had completed the\r\ncompilation of the Quran:\r\nAll praise be to Allah, who, although He is the Existent, cannot be conceived by the\r\nimagination. Intellects are prevented from imagining His Essence through likeness and\r\nform. His Essence does not alter. He is indivisible in His Perfection. He is the\r\nDistinguisher, but not through differences of place. He is the Establisher, but not\r\nthrough composition. He is the Knower, but not through instruments. His Knowledge\r\ndoes not depend on instruments.. There is no knowledge besides Him.\r\nIf it is said: He was there' then it is based on the eternity of His Existence. And if it\r\nis said: He is still there' then it is due to negating His non-existence. Thus, praise be\r\nHim and Exalted is He from the words of he who serve s other than Him and take a god\r\nother than Him, the Elevated, High. We extol Him with the praise that He approved for\r\nHis creation, and made mandatory upon Himself to accept it.\r\nI bear witness that there is no god but Allah, Alone, without associates, and I bear\r\nwitness that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger. The two witnesses elevate\r\nthe statement, and multiply the deeds. The scale of actions becomes lighter when these\r\ntwo witnesses are removed form it, and it becomes heavier when these two are places\r\nin it. With these two is the achievement of Paradise, escape from Hell, and crossing of\r\nthe Bridge (al-Sirat). With the two witnesses people may enter Paradise, and with\r\nsending blessings [salawat] people attain mercy. Therefore, increase the blessings you\r\nsend to your Prophet (SA) and his Progeny (AS): Verily, Allah and His Angels bless the\r\nProphet; O you who believe, send blessings unto him and salute him with a salutation\r\nworthy of respect.1\r\nO people! There is no honor greater than Islam, no nobility more respectful than piety,\r\nno refuge safer than godliness, no intercessor better than the repentance, no treasure\r\nmore beneficial than knowledge, no respect higher than forbearance, no value more\r\nemphatic than manners, no relation lower than anger, no beauty more attractive than\r\nintellect, no bad deed worse than lying, no protection more effective than quietness, no\r\ndress more beautiful than health, and no absence closer than death.\r\nO people, whoever has walked on the surface of the Earth will certainly fall to its depth.\r\nThe night and day are speedy in demolishing lives, and for every spark of life there is\r\nnourishment. For every seed there is a consumer, and you are the nutrients of death.\r\nMost certainly he who recognizes time does not neglect to get prepared (for the\r\nHereafter). No one escapes death, neither the rich through wealth, nor the poor through\r\npoverty.\r\nO people! Whoever fears his Lord refrains from oppression. He who does not guard his\r\ntongue, obscene language overtakes him; and he who does not know the difference\r\nbetween right and wrong belongs to the animal kingdom.\r\nHow small is suffering compared to tomorrow's need (the Day of Judgment)! How far it\r\nis! Your ignorance (of God) is caused by your defiance, and your sins. How close it:\r\nthe comfort from exhaustion and the misery from ease. Calamity is not calamity if it is\r\nfollowed by Paradise and the welfare is not welfare if it is followed by Hell. Every ease\r\nother than Paradise is inconsiderable and every tribulation other than the Hell is relief.",

AlMamum said to him: \"O son of the Messenger of Allah (SA), do you not say that the\r\nProphets are infallible?\"\r\nHe (AS) replied: \"Certainly.\"\r\nHe says that he asked him (AS) about some verses from the Quran. Among his\r\nquestions was: \"Then tell me about the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High, regarding\r\nIbrahim (AS): So when the night overshadowed him, he saw a star; said he: Is this my\r\nLord?\"1 Hence, (Ali) al-Rida (AS) responded:\r\nIbrahim (AS) was faced with three types of people: the first worshiped Venus, the\r\nsecond worshipped the moon, and the third worshiped the sun. This was when the\r\ncame out of the den in which he was hiding. So when the night overshadowed him, he\r\nsaw the planet Venus, and said: this is my Lord, as a denial and inquiry So when it set,\r\nhe aid: I do not love the setting one,2 because setting is one of the attributes of the\r\ncreated [muhdath] and not from the attributes of the Eternal [qadim].\r\nThen when he saw the moon rising, he asked: Is this my Lord? He said this as both\r\ndenial and inquiry. So when it set, he said: If my Lord had not guided me I should\r\ncertainly be of the erring people.3 Then when the day began and he saw the sun rising, he\r\nsaid: This is my Lord. This is greater than Venus and the moon. He (AS) said this as\r\ndenial and inquiry and not as information and approval.\r\nSo when it set, he said to all three types of people from the worshippers of Venus, the\r\nmoon and the sun: O my people! Surely I am clear of what you set up (with Allah).\r\nSurely I have turned myself, being upright, wholly to Him who originated the Heaven\r\nand the Earth, and I am not of the polytheists.4\r\nVerily, Ibrahim (AS) intended to clarify for them the invalidity of their religion, and prove\r\nto them that worshipping Venus, the Moon, and the Sun was wrong. Rather, service\r\nbelongs only to their Creator, the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth. The argument\r\nhe brought forth was inspired by Allah, the Mighty and High: And this was Our\r\nargument which we gave to Ibrahim against his people.5\r\nAl-Mamum said: \"For Allah's sake continue, O son of the Messenger of Allah!\"\r\nThe Compiler of this book says: The tradition is detailed; we have extracted from it the\r\nrequired passage.

Abu al-Abbas al-Fadl ibn al-Fadl ibn alAbbas al-Kindi related to me in which he has\r\npermitted me [ajaza] in Hamdan in the year 354 AH that Muhammad ibn Sahl that is al-Attar\r\nal-Baghdadi said word for word from his book in the year 305 AH that Abd Allah ibn\r\nMuhammad al-Balawi said: Umarah ibn Zayd related to me on the authority of Amar ibn\r\nMuhammad ibn Sasaah ibn Sawhan that My father related to me on the authority of Abu alMutamar Muslim ibn Aws who said\r\n\r\n      > \r\n\r\n  3\r\n65\r\n\r\n  2  \r\n\r\n> \r\n\r\nI attended a gather of Ali (AS) in the Mosque of al-Kufah. There a man stood up whose\r\ncolor was pale, as if he was a Yemeni Jew, and said: \"O Commander of the Faithful!\r\nDescribe your Creator, and praise Him for us such that we may see Him.\" Hence, Ali\r\n(AS) praised his Lord, and exalted His Greatness, the Mighty and High, in the following\r\nwords:\r\nAll praise be to Allah, who is the First not from something, nor hidden in something,\r\nand who does not vanish nor unite with something. He is not an imaginary delusion. He\r\nis neither a shape that He may be watched, not a body so He may have parts. He is not\r\nwith an end that He may terminate. He is not accidental [muhdath] so He may be seen.\r\nHe is neither covered that He may be uncovered, not is He with veils so He may be\r\ncomprised. He was there, but no space was there to carry Him in its sides, nor any\r\ncarrier to life Him with its power. Neither has He come into being after not being there.\r\nIn fact, the imaginations are baffled to assume a shape for the One who formed all\r\nthings and is still without space, and does not decline with the variation of time. He\r\ndoes not transform from one quality to another. He is far from the supposition of\r\nhearts. He is Exalted above all things and varieties. He is the Single, and the Knower\r\nof the Unseen. Thus, the meanings of the creation are negated from Him, and their\r\nsecrets are not hidden from Him.\r\nHe is the Known without quality. He is not perceived through the senses and not\r\ncompared with people. Eyes do not perceive Him. Thoughts cannot encompass Him.\r\nIntellects cannot assess Him, and imaginations cannot imagine Him. Hence, any\r\nlikeness of Him conceived by the intellect is limited. And how could He be described\r\nwith shapes and praised with eloquent tongues?\r\nHe neither occurred in things, so it may be said that He is in them, nor left them, that it\r\nmay be said that He is obvious. Neither is He free from them so it may be said where.'\r\n66\r\n\r\nHe is neither so close to them as to stick to them, nor so far from them as to be split.\r\nBut He is in the things without quality. He is closer to us than our jugular vein, and\r\nfurther ways than what is most far. He has neither created things with the origin of\r\neternity, nor from prior examples. In fact, He created what He created, and made it\r\nstrong. He imagined what He imagined and beautified it.\r\nThus, praise be Him who is Unique in His Elevation. Hence, nothing can refuse to Him\r\nHis decree. Nor does He gain anything through the obedience of His Creation. His\r\nResponse to callers is quick. The Angels in the Heavens and the Earth are submissive\r\nto Him. He addressed Moses with words without limbs, instruments, lips or uvulas.\r\nPraise be Him and Exalted is He from attributes.

So, he (Abu Qurrah) went to him, and asked him about the laws regarding the permissible and the forbidden, until he reached the subject of Divine Unity. Hence, Abu Qurrah said: \"It has been transmitted to us that Allah, the Mighty and High, divided vision and speech between two prophets; allocating speech to Musa (AS) and allocating vision for Muhammad (SA).\" Consequently, Abu al-Hasan (AS) replied: Who is it that brought the revelation from Allah, the Mighty and High, to both jinn and humankind? Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends (all) vision.1 And they do not comprehend Him in knowledge.1 Nothing whatsoever is like unto Him.2 Was it not Muhammad He said: \"Of course?\" If that is the case, then how could he come to all of creation, saying that he was sent by Allah, call them by His Command, that vision comprehend Him not, and He comprehend all vision. And they do not comprehend Him in Knowledge. Nothing whatsoever is like unto Him, and then claim that \"I have seen Him with my own eyes. I comprehend Him, and He has a human form.\" Are people not ashamed of saying such things? The unbelievers can use this against us: claiming that Allah revealed one thing and the Prophet contradicted it!

Then He informs of what he saw and says: Certainly he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.5 Thus, the signs of Allah, the Mighty and High, are other than Allah. As He has said: And they do not comprehend Him in knowledge. So, if the eyes saw Him, then they comprehended Him in knowledge, and recognition had taken place.

Ahmad ibn Ziyad ibn Jafar al-Hamadani (RA) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim said on the authority of his father Ibrahim ibn Hashim, on the authority of Abd al-Salam ibn Salih al-Hirawi that I asked Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS): \"O son of the Messenger of Allah! What do you say about the tradition of the Ahl al-Hadith1 that the Believers shall visit their Lord in Paradise from their own places?\" Hence, he (AS) replied: O Abu al-Salt! Verily, Allah, the Blessed and exalted, favored his Prophet Muhammad (SA) over all of His Creation. He favored him above all the Prophets and the angels. He made obedience to the Prophet obedience to Allah. He made following the Prophet following Allah. He made visiting the Prophet in this world and the Hereafter like visiting him.2 Thus, He, the Mighty and High, has said: Whoever obeys the Messenger, he indeed obeys Allah.3 And has said: Surely those who swear allegiance to you do but swear allegiance to Allah; the hand of Allah is above their hands.1 And the Prophet (SA) said: Whoever visits me in my life or after my death, has indeed visited Allah.' The place of the Prophet (SA) in Paradise is the most elevated place. Thus, whoever visits him in his place in Paradise from his own place, has certainly visited Allah, the Blessed and Exalted. I then asked him: \"O son of the Messenger of Allah, then what is the meaning of the report which they have transmitted that the reward of saying there is no god but Allah' is looking at the face of Allah?\" So he (AS) responded: O Abu al-Salt! Whoever claims that Allah ha a face like a human face has indeed disbelieved. The Face of Allah is, in fact, His Prophets, Messengers and Proof, may the blessings of Allah be upon them. They are the ones through whom Allah is noticed, through whom people turn to His Religion, and through whom Allah is witnessed. Hence, Allah, the Mighty and High, says: Everyone on it must pass away. And there will endure forever the Face of your Lord, the Lord of glory and honor.2 And He, the Mighty and High, says: Everything is perishable but His Face.3 Therefore, looking at Prophets of Allah, His Messengers and Proofs (AS) in their places is a great reward for the Believers on the Day of Judgment. Hence, the Prophet (SA) has said: \"Whoever hates my Household and Progeny, will not see me, and I will not see him on the Day of Judgment.\" And he (AS) said: \"Verily, there is among you who will not see me after they have parted from me\" O Abu al-Salt! Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is not limited to place. Vision and imagination do not comprehend Him. I then enquired from him: \"O son of the Messenger of Allah! Inform me about Paradise and Hell. Are they already created?\" He (AS) replied: \"Certainly! And the Messenger of Allah (SA) surely entered Paradise and saw Hell, when he ascended to Heaven.\" I asked him: \"There are people who say: they are both decreed, but not created yet.\" So he (AS) answered: Such people are not from us, and we are not from them. Whosoever denies the creation of Paradise and Hell belies the Prophet (SA) and belies us. Such people do not follow our authority, and will remain in hell-fire. Allah, the Mighty and High, says: This is the hell which the guilty called a lie. Round about shall they go between it and hot, boiling water.4 And the Prophet (SA) said: When I ascended to Heaven, Jibrail took me by the hand, and brought me to Paradise. He gave me some dates from Paradise, and I ate them, producing semen in my loins. When I came down to Earth and had contact with Khadijah (AS), she became pregnant with Fatimah (AS).

Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil (RA) said: Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Sadabadi said on he authority of Ahmad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Barqi, on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn Khalid, on the authority of Ahmad ibn al-Nadr, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Marwan, on the authority of Muhammad ibn al-Sa'ib, on the authority of Abu al-Salih that Abd Allah ibn Abbas was asked to interpret the Word of the Mighty and High: And when Musa came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said: My Lord! Show me (Thyself), so that I may look upon Thee. He said: You cannot (bear to) see Me but look at the mountain, if it remains firm in its place, then will you see Me; but when his Lord manifested to the mountain He made it crumble and Musa fell down in a swoon; then when he recovered, the said: Glory be to Thee, I turn to Thee, and I am the first of the Believers.1 He said: Musa (AS) said: \"Glory be to You, I turn to You from asking You to se You, and I am the first of the Believes who bears witness that you cannot be seen.\" Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn, the Compiler of this book (RA) says: Verily, Musa (AS) knew that it is not possible to see Allah, the Mighty and High. He surely asked Allah, the Mighty and High, to show Himself to him, so that he may look upon Him. Because his people insisted that he do so. Therefore, Musa (AS) asked the question to His Lord without taking permission from Him. He (AS) said: My Lord! Show me Yourself, so that I may look upon You. God replied: You cannot see Me but look at the mountain, if it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me. The meaning of this is that You will never se Me because the mountain never moves in any state. This is like the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: They shall not enter the garden until the camel passes through the eye of the needle.2 The meaning of this is that they will never enter the garden like the camel will never pass through the eye of the needle, but when his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain i.e. manifested a sign from His Signs. That sign was a light from the lights which He had created; He cast down His Might on that mountain. He made it crumble and Musa fell down in a swoon from fear of the earthquake which was shaking that mountain with its power. Then, when he recovered, he said: \"Glory be to You, I turn to You i.e. I return to my recognition of You, turning from my people and their request to see You.\" This repentence was not the result of a sin, since prophets do not commit major or minor sins. The permission before the question was not obligatory upon him; in fact, it was a form of politeness. He always used to d this prior to asking a question. According to one group, he had taken permission before asking that vision was not applicable to Allah, the Mighty and High. Regarding his statement: And I am the first of the Believers, Moses is saying that I am the first of the Believers from the group that were with him. They had asked him to take permission from his Lord to show Himself, so that he may look upon Him. The traditions that have transmitted regarding this subject, and which our elders (RA) have mentioned in their writings, are authentic as far as I am concerned. However, I refrained from transmitting them in this chapter fearing that some ignorant people may read them and interpret them literally, rejecting them, and disbelieving in Allah, the Mighty and High, out of ignorance. The traditions that Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa has mentioned in his Nawadir and those which Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Yahya has mentioned in his Jami regarding the vision of Allah are authentic. Only the ignorant and the unbelievers can reject them. Their wording is the wording of the Quran. These reports negate anthropomorphism [tashbih] and annulment [tatil] as a means of proving Divine Unity. Our Imams, may the blessings of Allah be upon them, have certainly ordered us not to address people beyond the capacity of their intellect. In these reports, the vision of Allah means the knowledge of Allah. In other words, this world is a place of doubt, uncertainty, and danger. Thus, when the Day of Judgment comes, the Signs of Allah and His Command will unveil for His servants and deliver both reward and punishment. Doubt will be eliminated, and all will attest to the reality and Omnipotence of Allah, the Mighty and High. The confirmation of this is in the Book of Allah, Mighty and High: Certainly you were heedless of it, but now We have removed from you your veil, so your sight today is sharp.1 So, the meaning of what is narrated in the tradition that He, the Mighty and High, will be seen is that He will be known with understanding and surety like His Word, the Mighty and High: Have you not seen your Lord, how He extends the shade?2 And His Word: Did you not see him (Namrud) who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord,3 and Hid Word: Did you not see those who went forth from their homes, in thousands, fearing death,4 and His Word: Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the fellows of the elephants?5 And other examples of this include that vision refers to the vision of the heart, and not the vision of the eyes. As for the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: but when his Lord manifested to the mountain, it means that He, the Mighty and High, made a sign appear as a Sign of the Signs of the hereafter which will make mountains into a mirage, and which will uproot the mountains and scatter them away as dust. The mountain crumbled and turned into dust, because it would not bear that sign. It is said: The light of the throne manifested itself upon the mountain.",

    "Content": "24. And the confirmation of what I have mentioned is what said Tamim ibn Abd Allah al-Qarashi (RA) that My father related to me on the authority of Hamdan ibn Sulayman al-Naysaburi, on the authority of Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Jahm that I was present in the gathering of al-Mamun and al-Rida Ali ibn Musa (AS) was with him; hence, al-Mamun asked him: \"O son of the Messenger of Allah! Do you not claim that the prophets (SA) are infallible?\" He (AS) replied: \"Of course.\" Hence, he asked him about the verses of the Quran. Among the questions he asked was: Then, what is the meaning of the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: And when Musa came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said: My Lord! Show me (Thyself), so that I may look upon Thee. He said: You cannot (bear to) see Me?1 How is it possible that Musa son of Imran (AS), to whom Allah ha spoken, did not know that Allah, Exalted be His Remembrance, cannot be seen, thus leading him to ask that question? So al-Rida (AS) answered: Verily, Musa ibn Imran (AS), to whom Allah has spoken, knew that Allah is far above being seen by human eyes. However, when Allah, the Mighty and High spoke to him, He made him draw nigh, Musa (AS) returned to his people and informed them that Allah, the Mighty and High, spoke to him and made him draw nigh. Therefore, the people responded: \"We will not believe in you until we hear His Speech like you head it.\" The people were seven hundred thousand men. He chose seventy thousand from them. Then, from these, he chose seven thousand. For these, he chose seven hundred. And, finally, from these seven hundred, he chose seventy men for the appointment of his Lord. He then went out to Mount Sinai, and stood them on the mountain slope. Musa (AS) climbed the Sinai, and asked Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, to speak to him, and to make them hear His Speech. Thus, Allah, Exalted be His Remembrance, spoke to him, and they heard His Speech from above, below, right, left, behind and in front, because Allah, the Mighty and High, created it in the tree, then directed the sound to them from the tree to them until they could hear it from all sides. Then they said: \"We will not believe that this is the speech of Allah until we see Allah manifestly.\" When they said these insolent words, they were all puffed up with pride. As a result, Allah, the Mighty and high, seized them for their oppression and struck them with a thunderbolt, killing them all. Musa (AS) then said: \"O Lord! What shall I say to the Israelites when I return to them and they say to me: You took them with you and killed them, because you were not truthful in your claim that Allah drew night to you.\" Thus, Allah raised them to life, and sent them with him. They then said: \"If you had asked Allah to show Himself to you s that you could see Him, He would certainly have answered you. Then, you could have described Him for us so that we could recognize Him they way He deserves to be recognized.\" Musa (AS) said: \"O people! Verily, Allah cannot be seen by human eyes and He is not subject to shape. He can only be recognized by His Signs and can only known through His Attributes.\" They said: \"We will not believe in you until you ask Him.\" Hence, Musa (AS) said: \"O Lord! You certainly heard the words of the Israelites, and You are the Most Knowledgeable of their interest. So Allah, Exalted be His Glory, revealed to him: \"O Musa! Ask Me what they have asked you for I will not resent you for their ignorance.\" At this point Musa (AS) said: My Lord! Show me (Thyself), so that I may look upon Thee. He said: You cannot see Me but look at the mountain, if it remains firm in its place (while it is shaking), then will you see Me; but when his Lord manifested to the mountain (a sign from His Signs) He made it crumble and Musa fell down in a swoon; then when he recovered, he said: Glory be to Thee, I turn to Thee (I am turning back to my recognition of You from the ignorance of my people), and I am the first of the Believers to profess that You cannot be seen.2 Al-Mamun expressed: \"For Allah's sake continue, O Abu al-Hasan.\" The Compiler of this book says: The tradition is detailed; we have extracted from it the required passage. I have transmitted all of it in the book Uyun Akhbar al-Rida (AS). If I had transmitted all the traditions which are narrated regarding the vision, surely the book would become lengthy with their mentioning, their explanation and proving their authenticity. Whoever Allah, Exalted be His Remembrance, grants success with right guidance, believe in all that is transmitted with the authentic chain of narrations from the Imam (AS), submits to them (AS) and consults their teachings when he is in doubt. This is because their words are the Words of Allah and their orders are the Orders of Allah. They are the closest in creation to Allah, the Mighty and High, and those with the greatest knowledge of Allah, may the blessings of Allah be upon them all.",

Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil (RA) said; Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim said on the authority of Muhammad ibn Abu Ishaq al-Khaffaf that some of our scholars related that Abd Allah al-Daysani come to Hisham ibn al-Hakam and asked him: \"Do you have a Lord?\" Hence, he replied: \"Of course.\" \"Is He Omnipotent [qadir]?\" He enquired. He answered: \"Yes, He is Omnipotent, and He is the Subduer.\" He asked: \"Does He have the power to place the whole world in an egg, without making the egg bigger or the world smaller?\" So Hisham responded: \"Can you give me some time?\" Therefore, he said: \"I shall give you some time.\" Then he left from his presence. Hisham went riding to Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) and asked for his permission to enter; hence, he permitted him. He then explained, \"O son of the Messenger of Allah (SA)! Abd Allah al-Daysani came to me with a question that no one can resolve except Allah and you.\" Thus, Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said to him, \"What is it that he asked you?\" So he replied, \"He said to me so and so.\" Thus, Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) explained, \"O Hisham! How many sense do you have?\" \"Five.\" Hisham answered. So the Imam (AS) asked, \"Which is the smallest of the senses?\" He said: \"The pupil (of the eye).\" \"What is the size of the pupil?\" The Imam (AS) enquired. Hisham responded, \"It is the size of a grain of lentil or even smaller than that.\" Thus, the Imam (AS) said: \"O Hisham! Look ahead and above you, and inform me of what you see.\" He replied, \"I see the sky, the Earth, houses, palaces, dust, mountains and rivers.\" Then, Abu Abd Allah (AS) said: \"Verily, the One who has the power to place what you see in a grain of lentil or seen smaller than that has the power to place the whole world in an egg, without making the world smaller or making the egg bigger.\" Hisham threw himself down to the Imam's feet and kissed his hands, head and feet, and then said: \"This is sufficient for me, O son of the Messenger of Allah.\" Then he returned to his house. The following day al-Daysani came to him and said; \"O Hisham, I have come to you, greeted you, and have not come demanding an answer.\" Hisham replied, \"Whether or not you came for an answer, I have it.\" Hence, al-Daysani left is present. He was informed that Hisham went to the presence of Abu Abd Allah (AS) and he has taught him the answer. Abd Allah al-Daysani left, and reached the door of Abu Abd Allah (AS). He asked for his permission to enter and the Imam permitted him. When he sat down, he said to the Imam (AS), \"O Jafar son of Muhammad! Guide me to my Lord.\" Thus, Abu Abd Allah (AS) asked, \"What is your name?\" So he walked out on the Imam (AS) and did not inform him of is name. Hence, he friends asked him, \"Why did you not tell him your name?\" He replied, \"If I had told that my name is Abd Allah, he would have said: Who is that you are the servant of?\" They said to him \"Return to him and tell him to guide you to your Lord without asking you your name.\" Therefore, he returned to him and said: \"O Jafar! Guide me to my Lord, and do not ask me about my name.\" Thus, Abu Abd Allah (AS) said to him, \"Sit down.\" He had a young boy, who had an egg in his hand and was playing with it. So Abu Abd Allah (AS) said: \"Young lad, bring me the egg.\" So he brought it to him. Abu Abd Allah (AS) further said: O Daysani, this is a concealed stronghold. It has a solid cover, and inside the solid cover there is soft layer. Inside the soft layer there is the egg-yolk and the albumin. Neither does the egg-yolk mix with the albumin not does the albumin mix the egg-yolk. Each remains in its state. No informer comes out of it to inform of its usefulness nor has a defect informed of its decay. No one knows whether it will make a male or a female. Colors lie that of the peacocks burst out of it. Do you not think that it is the product of Planner [mudabbir]? He put his head down for a long time, then said: \"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, Alone. He has no associates, and Muhammad is His Servant and Messenger, and you are an Imam and a Proof from Allah for His Creation. I repent for the misguidance in which I was in.\"",

He said: \"There is not a single human being among them, except the Shaykh who is sitting over there (meaning Jafar ibn Muhammad). The rest are nothing but riffraff and beasts.\" So Ibn Abu al-Awja' answered him, \"How is it that you apply the term (human being) to this shaykh and no to the others?\" \"Because I have seen in him what I do not see in them,\" he replied. Thus, Ibn Abu al-Awja' enquired, \"I must confirm for myself what you have said regarding him.\" Then, Ibn al-Muqaffa replied to him, \"Do not even go there! For, verily, I fear that you may destroy what you already have!\" He said: \"This is not your view. In fact, you fear that I will regard your view as weak once I see the one whom you have praised.\" Ibn al-Muqaffa then replied, \"If you suspect this then go to him, to have y our doubts removed. Do not be stubborn. It will protect you from hesitation. Inform him of what may benefit or harm you.\" The reporter says that Ibn Abu al-Awja' got up and Ibn al-Muqaffa and I remained. Then he returned to us and said: \"O Ibn al-Muqaffa! He is not a human being, even though he may be a mystic [ruhani] in this world. If he desires, he appears as a body. If he desires, he conceals himself as a spirit. This is what he is.\" He asked, \"How is that?\" He replied, \"I sat near him. When there was no one there other than me, he (AS) said to me, \"If things are as people claim, and if they believed in what they professed, (referring to the people circumambulating the Kabah), then they are safe, and you are destroyed. However, if the matter is the way you all say it, and it certainly is not, then you are both equal.\" I asked him, \"May Allah have mercy on you! What is it that we say and what is it that they say? My statement and their statement is nothing but the same.\" He (AS) responded, \"How can your statement and their statement be one when they say that they have a return, reward, and punishment. They affirm that the sky has a Lord and it is inhabited while you claim that the sky is wasteland and there is no one there.\" Ibn Abu al-Awja' says that I availed the opportunity from him and asked him, What ha stopped Him, if the matter is the way you say it, to appear to His Creation and call them to His service so that any two of them may not differ from each other? Why has He hidden Himself from them, and has sent the Messengers to them? If He had directly come in contact with them, more would believe in Him. Thus, he (AS) replied to me, Woe to you! How is He hidden from you when He showed you His Omnipotence in your own self? He brought you into being when you did not exist. His Omnipotence is shown in your old age after youth, in your strength after weakness, and in your weakness after strength; in your illness after health, and your health after illness; in your pleasure after anger, and your anger after pleasure; in your sadness after happiness, and your happiness after sadness; in liking after disliking, and in disliking after liking; in deciding after refusing, and in refusing after deciding; in kindness after meanness, and in meanness after kindness, in your exhortation after apprehension, and apprehension after exhortation; in your hope after despair, and your despair after hope; in the idea which was not in your imagination, and in the distance between what you believe from your mind.

There is nothing that exists besides Him. He is Light without darkness, Truth without falsehood, Justice without oppression, and Reality without Non-reality. He has never vanished nor ever will. He was there when there was no Earth or sky. He was there when there was no night or day. He was there when there was no sun or moon. He was there when there were no stars, clouds, rain or wind. Then Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, wished to make a creation that would revere His Majesty, glorify His Magnificence, and honor His Sublimity. Thus, He commanded: \"Be you both protectors;\" therefore, they were as Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has said. The Compiler of this Book (RA) says: The meaning of the statement: He is Light, is that He is the One who Illuminates and He is the Guide. The meaning of His Word: \"Be you two protected\" is the Holy Spirit [al-Ruh al-Muqaddas] and the Angel Drawn Near. What is intended by this is that Allah was there when there was nothing with Him, so He intended to create His Messengers, His Proofs, and His Witnesses. Thus, He created before them the Holy Spirit, through which Allah, the Mighty and High, supports His Messengers, Proofs and Witnesses, may the blessings of Allah be upon them all. It is through the Holy Spirit that Allah guards them from the deception and the whispers of Satan. Allah directs them, succeeds them and assists them through true thoughts. Then He created the Trustworthy Spirit [al-Ruh al-Amin] through whom the Mighty and High sent revelation to the Messengers, and said to both of them: Be you both protector' for My Prophets, Messengers, Proofs, and Witnesses. He helps them through the two, assists them with their hands, and guards them through the two. Based on this concept, it is said the Just Ruler is the Protector appointed by Allah to guard His Earth and His Servants. The oppressed seek shelter from him, the fearful and wayfarers feel safe by him, and through him the weak demand justice from the strong. This is Allah's Ruler and His Proof, which the Earth is not fee from until the Day of Judgment.",

And the proof had been established for Allah, the Mighty and High, being\n without beginning [qadim], It is impossible that He may be Eternal in one dimension, and have\n beginning another.\nAnother proof that Allah, Blessed and Exalted be He, is without beginning is that if He had a\nbeginning then there must have been someone that gave Him a beginning, because an action\nrequires an agent. And surely the word about one who gave beginning to Him is like the word\nabout Him. And in this (case) there is existence of an eternal before an eternal that has no\nprior (to Him). This is impossible. Hence, it is correct that there must be an Eternal Creator.\nAnd if it is so, then whatever demands the eternity of that creator and indicates upon him, also\ndemands the eternity of the Creator we believe in and indicates upon Him.",

He is the Lord of Everything, their Master,\n their Creator, and is the One who gave them beginning.\n Verily, Muhammad (SA) is His Servant and His Messenger, the Seal of the Messengers;\n hence, there is no Messenger after him till the Day of Judgment.

And I affirm: Verily, the Ascension (of Muhammad (AS) to the\n Heavens) [Mi'raj] is true, the questioning in the grave is true; Heaven is true, and Hell is\n true.

Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Ishaq al-Taliqani (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Said ibn Yahya\n al-Buzuri said: Ibrahim ibn al-Haytham al-Baladi said: My father said on the authority of al-\n Muafi ibn Imran, on the authority of Israil, on the authority of al-Miqdad ibn Shurayh ibn\n Hani', on the authority of his father that\n On the Day of Battle of Jamal, a Bedouin stood before the Commander of the Faithful\n (AS), and asked, \"O Commander of the Faithful! Do you say that Allah is One?\"\n He says: the people attacked him saying that \"O Bedouin! Do you not see the state of\n mind of the Commander of the Faithful?\"\n So the Commander of the Faithful (AS) said: \"Leave him alone. Verily, what this\n Bedouin seeks to know is what we are seeking to establish by fighting these people.\"\n He (the Commander of the Faithful) then said:\n O Bedouin! The statement that Allah is One' is of four types: Two types cannot be\n applied to Allah, the Mighty and High; while the two other types can be applied to Him.\n As for the two types of statements that cannot be applied to Him, the first is the claim\n that Allah is One in a numerical sense. Such a statement cannot be applied to Allah,\n because as the One, He has no second, and He is not subject to mathematic\n calculation. Do you not see that he who claims that Allah is the third of the three has\n disbelieved (in Him)?\nThe second statement which cannot be applied to Allah is the claim that He is One with\nhumankind. Since He derives the species from the genus, He cannot be described\nthrough anthropomorphism [tashbih]. Our Lord is Higher and more Exalted than this.\n As for the two types of statements that can be applied to Allah, the first would be to say\n that He is the One who resembles none. The second statement which can apply to Allah\n is the statement that He, the Mighty and High, is Alone, in the sense that He is\n Indivisible in Existence [wujud], Intellect [aql], and Thought [wahm]. That is another\n dignified description of our Lord, he Mighty and High.\nThe Compiler of this book says: I have heard the following from a person I trust due to the fact\nthat he is religious and due to his mastery of both Classical and colloquial Arabic:\n Verily, the words one, two three, and so forth, were developed in order to express quantity, and\n not to express quality. They have no meaning outside of counting, and determining units of\n measure in the tens, hundreds, and thousands.\n Likewise, when someone intends to inform another person about the exact quantity of a thing, he\nnames it by its specific name, and applies the number one' to it, describing its quantity, as\nopposed to its attributes. This is why one says: one pound [dirham], and one intends only a\npound, while it could be a pound in weight or a pound in number. So, if the persons want to\nconvey the meaning of weight, he would say: one pound in weight, but if he wants to convey\nthe meaning of number, he says; one pound in number.\n On the basis, if a person says \"one man,\" the man can be one in the sense that he is one\n human being, as opposed to two. Or, he could be unique in merits, unique in knowledge,\n unique in generosity or unique in bravery. Thus, if a person intends to convey the sense of\nquantity, he says: \"one man;\" in the sense that he is one man as opposed to two men.\n However, if he intends to describe someone's excellence, he says: he is one of a kind (there is\nno one' like him). This indicates that nobody compares to him. If he wanted to stress the\nknowledge of a person, he would say: he is unique in knowledge. Hence, since the word one'\ncan indicate excellence, as well as quantity, it means that whoever called him one' under\nthese circumstances meant that there he had no second. In other words, there was no scholar\nlike him, and no person like him in quality.\n When this is not the case, then it is correct to say that one' merely indicates quantity.\n Otherwise, there, would be no sense in saying one of a kind' or limiting the meaning of\nknowledge or bravery. It has been established that when a person uses the word \"one\" on its\nown, it indicates quantity. However, depending on the context, it can also mean \"one\" or\n\"unique\" in knowledge, excellence, and generosity.\n As we have already explained, one' pound [dirham] can be one pound in weight, one pound\n in number or count. It can also be two pounds in weight, and one pound in number or count.\n Sometimes it is six dawaniq,1 and sixty fulus,2 and has many fractions. Likewise, a slave can\n be one salve, and not two slaves; a person can be one person, and not two people, when in\n reality they are composed of many parts which are composed of many more parts.\n In this sense, the slave cannot be one.' Verily, the slave is not one or unique [wahid], because\n every slave has someone who is similar to him. It makes perfect sense for a slave to have\n someone who is the same as him in attributes and qualities. Hence it is necessary that Allah, the\nMighty and High, be Unique in His Attributes and Most Beautiful Names. This is what\nmakes Him truly One God, who has no likeness; the One, who has no associates; and there is\nno god but He.\n Therefore, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is the One, the Eternal3 [qadim], and there is no\n god but He. He is Unique, none is eternal but He, the Existing, who does not change, and is\n not subject to change. He is the One beyond compare. Nothing is similar to Him. Nothing\n resembles Him. And nothing is like Him. Thus, He is an Indivisible Being in both Essence and\n Imagination, a Think unlike other Things, and the One and Only True God. There is no god but\nIn conclusion, in Islamic Law, the titles the One [Wahid], and the Unique [Ahad], apply\nspecifically to Him, and are excluded from others. None but Allah, the Mighty and High, can\nbear these titles. And, as we have already explained, Allah is a name which can only applied\nto Him.\nIn addition to these examples, a thing can sometimes be counted with something which is\nsimilar to it. It is said: this is a man, these are two men, and these are three men; this is a\nslave, this is black, these are two slaves, these two are black. Therefore, it is not permissible\nto say: these are two gods as there is no god but the One God. Thus, Allah cannot be counted\nin this manner, nor does He enter numbers in this form in any way.\nSometimes a thing is counted with something different to it. Hence, it is said: this is the color\nwhite, these are white and black colors; this is a recent one [muhdath], these are two recent\nones; these are not two ones, and these are not two creatures; One of them is Eternal, and\nthe other is recent; one of them is the Lord, and the other is the servant.\n So, on this basis, it is acceptable to apply numbers to Him as Allah, the Blessed and Exalted,\nhas said: Nowhere is there a secret counsel between three persons but He is the Fourth of\nthem, not (between) five but He is the Sixth of them, nor less than that nor more but He is with\nthem wheresoever they are.1 Similarly, the statement Verily', he is one man' does not merely\nstress his excellence. Likewise, our statement, so and so in number two to so and so,' does\nnot simply indicate that he exist. It only does so when it is specified that he is second to him in\nexcellence, in perfection, or in knowledge.'\n As for the Unity of Allah, Exalted is His Remembrance, it refers to the Unity between His\nExalted Attribute, and His Most Beautiful Names. He is One, without associates, and without\nsimilarity. He who affirms this about the Mighty and High on the basis of His Exalted Attribute\nand Most Beautiful Names with conviction is a true monotheist. Hence, the one who fails to\nrecognize Allah, the Mighty and High, through his Exalted Attributes, and Most Beautiful\nNames, does not affirm His Oneness, and is not a true monotheist.\n Sometimes the ignorant people say: Verily, a monotheist is one who professes the Oneness of\nAllah even if He does profess the Unity of His Attributes. The ignorant people are told: You\nhave rejected Divine Unity. Whoever claims that His Lord is One God, and One Being, and\nthen applies His Attributes to other than Him, is an idolater, an anthropomorphist, and a non-\nMuslim according to the consensus of every school of thought in the Ummah. Such is the\ncase, even if he claims that His Lord id One God, One Thing and One Being.\n Accepting Divine Unity, while failing to accept the Divine Attributes, is like saying Allah is\nseparate from His Attributes whereas Divine Unity is the Unity between Allah and His\nAttributes. I is impossible for another god to exist. Allah is One God without partners, and\nwithout similarity. If He was not United with His Attributes, then he would have an associate or\nsomething similar to Him. Likewise, if a servant did not embody him own attributes, another\nservant would have to exist. As a result, he would not be one servant, but two servants.\n Hence, anyone who professes that Allah is One with His Attributes is a true monotheist, and a\nBeliever in Divine Unity.\nAllah, the Mighty and High, unites every attribute which is applicable exclusively to Him. These\nattributes include the Existent since it cannot be conceive that He can dissolve into something\nor that something can dissolve into Him. Nor is it conceivable that His Existence can come to an\nend, that He can be destroyed, or that He can suffer any type of decline. He is the First of the\nFirst, the Last of the Last, and the Omnipotent.\n He is not subject to weakness or inability. He is the Most Powerful of the Powerful, and the\nSubduer [qahir] of all Subduers. He is Omniscient: nothing is hidden from Him, and nothing\nescapes Him. He is the Most Learned of the Learned. Ignorance, mistakes, errors, doubts, and\nforgetfulness cannot be attributed to Him. He is the Ever-Living. He is not subject to sleep or\ndeath. Nothing benefits Him nor can anything harm Him. He is the One who Remains, the\nMost Complete of the Complete, and the Doer who is never occupied. Nothing incapacitates\nHim nor does He miss anything. He is the Lord of the First and Last, the Best of Creators, and\nthe Foremost of those who take account.\n He is the Wealthy One [ghani], devoid of nothing. He is the Self-Sufficient [mustaghni], devoid\nof need. He is the Just, devoid of criticism and defects. He is the Wise One, devoid of\nfoolishness. He is the Most Merciful, whose Mercy cannot be increased kindness.2 He is the\nForbearing [halim], devoid of emotion and haste. He is the Most Just of the Just, the Best of\nJudges, and the Foremost of those who take Account. This is because the first of the First\ncannot be but One. He is the Omnipotent, the Most Learned, the Best of Judges, the Best of",

    "Content": "6. Wahab ibn Wahab al-Qurashi related\n I heard al-Sadiq (AS) saying that a delegation from Palestine came to al-Baqir (AS) and\n enquired about issues so he answered them. Then they asked him about the Needless [al-\nSamad]; hence, he said:\nThe meaning of the Needless [al-Samad] is found in the five letters of the word itself:\nAlif means to ascertain His Essence [inniyyat], as in the Word of the Mighty and High:\nAllah bears witness that there is no god but He,1 which means that he is not subject to\nsensory perception. The lam stands for divinity [ilahiyyah] and means that He, and only\nHe, is Allah. The Alif and Lam are not pronounced by the tongue, and are not heard in\nlistening; however, they appear in writing, demonstrating that His Divinity is a Secret of\nHis Benevolence. The senses do not perceive them. They are not perceived in the\nwords of the speaker, and they are not heard by ears of the listener.\n This is because the meaning of the word God [ilah] is: the One whose Essence and\nNature cannot be perceived by the imagination or the senses. On the contrary, their\n[alif, lam] appearance in writing is an indication that Allah, Glory be to Him, manifested\nHis Lordship through the creation of subtle spirits and unsubtle bodies. When a servant\nlooks at himself, he does not see his spirit in the same way that the lam does not\nbecome evident, and is not perceived y any of the five sense. However, when he looks\nat the written form, what is hidden and elegant becomes evident to him. Thus,\nwhenever a servant ponders the Essence of the Maker [al-bari'] and His Nature, he is\noverwhelmed and amazed, as his thoughts cannot grasp the concept of God, because\nHe, the Mighty and High, is the Creator of Concepts. When he looks at the creation, however, he is forced to acknowledge that the Mighty and High is the creator and\nComposer of both spirits and bodies.\n As for the sad, it symbolizes that He, the Mighty and High, is al-Sadiq, the Truthful. His\nWords are the Truth. His Speech is the Truth. He calls upon His Servants to follow the\ntruth, and He has promised in truth the place of Truth. The mim symbolizes His\nKingdom [mulk], and that He is the Righteous King who surrenders not, and whose\nKingdom never declines.\n And the dal symbolizes the eternity [dawam] of His Kingdom and that He, the Mighty\nand High, is Eternal. Exalted be He, the Mighty and High, from being created or from\ndeclining. He originated the Universe, and created all beings.\n He (AS) then added,\n If I had found a bearer for my knowledge, bestowed upon me by Allah, the Mighty and\n High, I would have certainly spread Divine Unity, Islam, Faith, Religion, and Islamic law\n on the basis of the word the Needless' [al-Samad]. And how could it be possible for me\nto find someone to carry my knowl3edge, when even my grandfather, the Commander\nof the Faithful (AS) did not find any bearer for his knowledge, causing him to sigh\ndeeply, and proclaim the following from the pulpit: Ask me before you lose me, for\nverily I am full of knowledge. Alas I cannot find any hone who can bear it. Beware! I am\nthe Proof of Allah upon you. Hence, do not support the people with whom Allah is\nangry. Do not support people who have no hope in the Hereafter just like the\nunbelievers are hopeless like the dead. Then al-Baqir (AS) added:\nPraise be to Allah who granted us favor, and success in serving Him, the Unique, on\nwho all depend, who begets not, nor is He begotten, and none is like Him. He kept us\naway from worshipping idols. Everlasting praise be to Him, and permanent thanks be to\nHim. The interpretation of His Word, the Mighty and High: He begets not, nor is He\nbegotten, is as follows: He, the Mighty and High, has not given birth to have a son as an\nheir, nor is He begotten so that He would have a father who would share His Lordship\nand Kingdom; and none is like Him, so that another would assist Him in His Rule.",

I will simply summarize it: He considers\nAllah to be a body because things are of two types: bodies or actions of bodies. Hence,\nif it is not possible for the creator to be an action, it is only possible that He be a Doer.\nThen Abu Abd Allah (AS) replied: \"Woe to him! Does he not know that a body is\nextremely limited, and an image is absolutely limited? Hence, if a limit is possible then\nincrease and decrease are possible, and if increase and decrease are possible, then He\nis created. I asked: \"Then what should I say?

If He were as he (Hisham) says then there\nwould be no difference between the Creator and the created, or between the Inventor\nand the invented. However, He is the Inventor.

The first group attempts to describe\n Him through anthropomorphism. The second group attempts to describe Him through\n negation. And the third group attempts to describe Him without falling into\n anthropomorphism. Describing Him through anthropomorphism is not allowed, and\ndescribing Him through negation is not allowed.

Al-Husayn ibn Ahmad ibn Idris (may Allah have mercy on him) said, on the authority of his\n father, on the authority of Abu Said al-Adami, on the authority of Bishr ibn Bashshar al-\nNaysaburi that:\n I wrote to Abu al-Hasan al-Naqi (AS) informing him that the people differed on the\n subject of Divine Unity. Some of them say \"He has a body\" while others say that \"He\nhas an image.\"\n So, he (AS) wrote (back): \"Glory be to Him who has no limit, who cannot be described,\nand with whom nothing resembles! Nothing whatsoever is like unto Him. And He is the\nAll-Hearing and the All-Seeing.\"\n14. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar (may Allah have mercy on him)\n said: on the authority of his father, on the authority of Sahl ibn Ziyad that\n I wrote the following to Abu Muhammad al-Askari (AS) in the year 255 AH:\n O my Master! Our scholars are divided on the question of Divine Unity. Some of them\n say that \"He has a body,\" while others say that \"He has an image.\" O my Master! If you\n deem it appropriates, teach me the correct view since I do not know the answer, and be\n gracious to your servant.\n Hence, he (AS) wrote to me the following in his own handwriting:\n You enquired about Divine Unity. This is far from your honorable reach. Allah, the\n Exalted, is One, Alone, and Needless. He begets not, nor is He begotten, and none is\n equal unto Him. He is the Creator, and not the created. He, the Blessed and exalted,\n creates bodies as He wishes. He creates images as He wishes, but He is not an image.\n Exalted be His Praise, and Hallowed be His names. He is far above having a\n resemblance. There is no other than Him. Nothing whatsoever is like unto Him, and He\n is the All-Hearing and the All-Seeing.\n15. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Saffar said: al-Abbas ibn Maruf said: Ibn Abu Najran said, on the\n authority of Hammad ibn Uthman, on the authority of Abd al-Rahim al-Qasir that\n I wrote a letter, and sent it by hand via Abd Al-Malik ibn Ayan to Abu Abd Allah al-\n Sadiq (AS). In it, I asked about several issues, one of which was: \"Please inform me\n about Allah, the Mighty and High. Can He be described with image and lineation? If this\n letter reaches you, may Allah make me your ransom, write back to me with the correct\n vies about Divine Unity.\"\n So he (AS) wrote back to me, sending the letter via Abd al-Malik ibn Ayan:\n May Allah have mercy on you! You have enquired about Divine Unity. Allah is Greater\n than what your companions have ascribed. He is All-Hearing and All-Seeing, and there\n is nothing like unto Him. Allah is greater than the descriptions of the describers,\nthose who describe Him inhuman terms, and those who compare Him with His creation,\nthus slandering Allah.\n Beware! May Allah have mercy on you! The correct view about Divine Unity is to be\nfound in the attributes that Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed in the Quran. Reject\nanthropomorphism, and do not apply to Allah what is vain. Allah is Firmly Present.\nAllah is high above the descriptions of the describers. Do not exceed the Quran, as\nyou will misled after the clear explanation has reached you.\n16. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar (may Allah have mercy on him) said, on the\n authority of his father, on the authority of Sahl ibn Ziyad, on the authority of some of our\n scholars that\n I wrote to Abu al-Hasan al-Kazim (AS) asking him about the body and image of Allah, so\n he replied in writing: \"Glory be to Him who has nothing whatsoever like unto Him, and\n who is devoid of both body and image.\"\n17. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, on the\n authority of his father, on the authority of Sahl ibn Ziyad al-Adami, on the authority of Hamzah\n ibn Muhammad that\n I wrote to Abu al-Hasan al-Kazim (AS) asking him whether Allah had a body or an\n image. Hence he (AS) wrote in reply: \"Glory be to Him who has nothing whatsoever like\n unto Him,\"\n18. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Barqi (may Allah have\n mercy on him) said, on the authority of his father, on the authority of his grandfather Ahmad\n ibn Abu Abd Allah, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abd Allah ibn Bahr, on\n the authority of Abu Ayyub al-Khazzaz, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Muslim that\n I asked Abu Jafar al-Baqir (AS) about the claim that Allah, the Mighty and High, created\n Adam (AS) in His Image; hence, he said:\n That was a recently created image. Allah favored it, and chose it over all different\n images. Then He attributed it to Himself like He attributed the Kabah and the Sprit to\n Himself. Thus, He said: My House.1 And said: And when I breathed into him My Spirit.2\n19. Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Abd Allah\n ibn Jafar al-Himyari said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority\n al-I Hasan ibn Mahbub, on the authority of Yaqub al-Sarraj that\n I said to Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS): \"Some of our scholars think that Allah looks like\n a human being, while others think that he is beardless and has curly hair.\"\n Abu Abd Allah (AS) fell down in prostration, then raised his head, and said:\n Glory be Allah who has nothing whatsoever like unto Him! Vision cannot perceive Him,\nand knowledge cannot encompass Him. He begets not, because the son resembles his\nfather, not is He begotten, so that He could resemble the one before Him. And none is\nlike Him. Exalted is He, the High, and Mighty from such attributions!\n20. Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ali ibn\n Ibrahim ibn Hashim said, on the authority of his father, on the authority of al-Saqr ibn [Abu]\n Dulaf that\n I asked Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS) about Divine\n Unity: \"Verily, I say what Hisham ibn al-Hasam said.\"\n So he (AS) became angry and said:\n What is the matter with you and Hisham? Indeed, he is not from us who thinks that\n Allah, the Mighty and High, has a body. We are free from such a person in this world,\n and in the Hereafter. O son of [Abu] Dulaf!

In so doing, you are saying that His Omnipotence is something other than Him. You are saying that He used His Omnipotence as a tool with which He creates, and that would be polytheism. When you say that Allah has created things using His Omnipotence, it is as if you consider Omnipotence to be separate from Him, and that He obtains His Power over things through it. However, Allah is neither weak nor incapable, nor is He is need of others. Muhammad ibn Ali, the Compiler of this book says: When we say that Allah is Omnipotent, we negate any inability from Him. We do not affirm that Omnipotence co-exists along with Him, because He, the Mighty and High, is the One and Only.

Al-Mamun asked him: \"O son of the Messenger of Allah (SA)! Do you not claim that the Prophets are infallible?\" He (AS) replied: \"Certainly.\" He asked him (AS) about some verses from the Quran. Among his questions was: \"Then tell me about the Word of Ibrahim (AS): My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead, He said: What! And do you not believe? He said: Yes, but that my heat may be at ease.\"1 Al-Rida (AS) replied, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, revealed to Ibrahim (AS) that I will choose a friend for Me from among My Servants such that I will even revive the dead for him if he asks Me to do so. It then occurred to Ibrahim (AS) that he was that friend. Thus, he asked, \"My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead.\" He said: \"What! And do you not believe?\" He said: \"Yes, but my heart will be at ease knowing that I am your Friend.\" Then Allah said: Then take four of the birds, then train them to follow you, then place on every mountain a part of them, then call them, they will come to you flying; and know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.\"2 Then Ibrahim (AS) took an eagle, a peacock, a duck, and a rooster. He chopped them into pieces and mixed them up. He then placed a part of their mixed flesh on top of each of the ten hills in that area. He held each bird's beak in his hand. He placed some seeds and water near himself and called out to them. The various parts of beach bird started to fly towards each other until a perfect body was formed. Each body went towards its own head and joined it to become a living bird. Then Ibrahim (AS) let their beaks go. The birds flew and then landed. They drank water, ate some seeds, and said: \"O Prophet of Allah! You have brought us back to life. May Allah bring you back to life.\" Ibrahim (AS) said: \"It is Allah who brings back to life and takes away life.

    "Content": "Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Abu Abd\nAllah al-Kufi said: Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Barmaki said: Jafar ibn Sulayman al-Jafari said:\nMy father said, on the authority of Abd Allah ibn al-Fadl al-Hashimi, on the authority of Sad\nal-Khaffaf, on the authority of al-Asbagh ibn Nubatah that\n\nWhen the Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abut Talib (AS) was facing the Khawarij\n(rebels), admonishing them, reminding them, and cautioning them before the battle, he\nwarned them, \"Do you want to take revenge from me? Beware! Verily, I was the first to\nbelieve in Allah and His Messenger (SA).\" They said:\"You are as you claim, except you\nmade Abu Musa al-Ashari the arbitrator [Hakam] in the religion of Allah.\" Hence, he\n(AS) responded: By Allah, I did not make any created being an arbitrator. Verily, I\nmade the Qur'an the arbitrator. Had I not, I would have been defeated in my affair and\nopposed for my view. When I agreed to the battle between me and the enemies of Allah,\nit was to raise the Word of Allah and help the Religion of Allah, even if the unbelievers\nand the ignorant abhorred it.\nThe Compiler of this book explains: It has been mentioned in this book that the Qur'an is the\nWord of Allah, His Revelation, His Speech, and His Book. What has not been mentioned in\nthis book is that it is created. We have indeed refrained from applying the word \"created\" to it,\nbecause the word \"created\" literally may mean \"made-up\". It is said: \"Created speech,\" i.e.\nmade-up. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says: You only worship idols besides Allah and\nyou create a lie, i.e. make up a lie. The Exalted has said regarding those who deny Divine\nUnity: We never heard of this in the former faith; this is nothing but a forgery, i.e.\nfabrication and a lie. Therefore, whoever believes that the Qur'an is created, in the meaning of\nbeing made-up, he has disbelieved. On the other hand, whoever says that it is not created,\nin the sense that it is not made-up, he is correct and has spoken the truth. Whoever believes\nthat it is uncreated, in the sense that it is not accidental, not revealed, and unprotected, then he is\nmistaken and has said something false and inappropriate.\nIt is the consensus of all Muslims that the Qur'an is not metaphorically the Word of Allah, the\nMighty and High, but is literally the Word of Allah. Whoever says other than that, then he is in\ndenial and falsehood. If we examine the Qur'an, we find it to be elaborate: Some parts are\nconnected to others, some parts are disconnected, some verses come before others, for\nexample, so abrogators come later than the abrogated. Even if with this description it is not\naccidental, then the evidence on the occurrence of the accidental beings would be void It\nwould be impossible to prove the One that caused it to be finite, separated and joined.\nThe other thing is that the intellect acknowledges that the Ummah has formed a consensus\nthat Allah, the Mighty and High, is Truthful in His Communications. As is well-known, a lie is to\ncommunicate something which has not happened. Allah, the Mighty and High, cited the\nstatement of the Pharoah: I am your lord, the most high. He cited Nuh (AS) when he called\nupon his son who did not want to join him: O my son! Embark with us and be not with the\nunbelievers. Thus, if these statements and communications were eternal, then they existed\nbefore the Pharoah, and before he said it; hence, they would not be informative. This is what a\nlie is. However, if these words were not said until the Pharoah said them, they are accidental,\nwhich means they came into existence from non-existence.\nThe other point is that Allah, the Mighty and High, says: And if We please, We should\ncertainly take away that which We have revealed to you. And His Word: Whatever\ncommunications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or\nlike it. Whatever has a likeness and whatever can vanish after existence is accidental.",

    "Content": "The confirmation of this is of this is what our Shaykh Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad\nibn al-Walid (RA) has mentioned in his Jami; and said, on the authority of Muhammad ibn alHasan al-Saffar, on the authority of al-`Abbas ibn Marub that Abd al-Rahman ibn Abu Najran\nrelated to me, on the authority of Hammad ibn Uthman, on the authority of Abd al-Rahim alQasir that\n\nI wrote to Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) and sent it with Abd al-Malik ibn Ayun:\nMay I be your ransom! I write to you regarding matters in which people have differed. If\nyou seem it appropriate, may Allah take me as your ransom, then please answer me.\nThe people of Iraq have differed regarding recognition and denial. May I be your\nransom, are they created? They have also differed regarding the Qur'an. One group\nclaims that the Qur'an is the uncreated Word of Allah, and the other group claims that it\nis the created Word of Allah. As regards ability, does it take place before the action or\ndoes it occur simultaneously along with the action? Our Companions have differed\nabout it, all quoting traditions to support their views. As regards Allah, the Blessed and\nExalted, can He be described by means of an image? If you deem it fitting, please\nrespond to me in writing with the correct position regarding Divine Unity, whether\nmotion is created or uncreated, and with the definition of faith. Hence, he (AS) wrote\nand sent it back with Abd al-Malik ibn Ayun: You asked about the nature of\nrecognition. Then know, may Allay have mercy on you, that recognition was created by\nAllah, the Mighty and High, and placed in the heart of the created, and denial was\ncreated by Allah, and placed in the hearts of the created. The only control that servants\nhave over these two is choice. Hence, if they yearn for faith, they recognize Allah, and\nbecome believers. However, if they yearn for infidelity, they deny Allah and become\nunbelievers who are led astray. Whoever embraces faith, Allah grants him success. And\nwhoever rejects faith is forsaken by Allah. If Allah punishes or rewards them it is due to\nthe choices they made. You asked, may Allah have mercy on you, about the dispute\nthat people have concerning the Qur'an. They say that the Qur'an, is the Word of Allah,\nthat it is accidental, that it is uncreated, and that it is not eternal alongside Allah, may\nHis Remembrance be Exalted. Exalted is Allah, the Elevated, and the Great, from such\nthings! Allah, the Mighty and high, existed when nothing other than Him was known or\nunknown. The Mighty and High existed when there was no speaker, no intender, no\nmover, and no doer. High and Mighty is our Lord. The Qur'an is the Word of Allah, and\nis not created. It contains information of those who came before you and those who will\ncome after you. It was revealed by Allah to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, peace\nand salutations be upon him and his progeny. You also asked, may Allah have mercy on\nyou, about the ability to act. Allah the Mighty and High, created the servant. He\nplaces in the servant the ability, the health, and the strength to act. Nothing moves\nwithout action. Movement and desire are qualities which Allah created and placed in\nhuman beings. Hence, when a human being desires something, he wishes it. It is for\nthis reason that the human being is called \"the intender.\" If a human being intends to\ncomplete an action, he does so by means of ability and motion. It is for this reason that\nthe servant is called \"the one with ability\" and \"the one who moves.\" Therefore, even\nwhen the human being is still, and does not wish to complete an action, he possesses\nthe ability to act due to health, strength, and motion. Hence, stillness is an action: the\naction of refraining to act. Hence, it is said: \"the one that is still,\" is attributed with\n\"stillness.\" Therefore, when a human being desires to act, he does so by means of the\nstrength which he posses. Hence, it is said that he is: \"the doer,\" \"the mover,\" \"the\nacquirer\" and \"the one who is able.\" Do you not see that these are all human\nattributes? You also asked, may Allah have mercy on you, about divine Unity and the\nviews of your companions on that subject. Exalted is Allah, who has nothing\nwhatsoever like unto Him. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Exalted is Allah from\nthe descriptions of the anthropomorphist who compare Allah, the Blessed and Exalted,\nwith His Creatures, attributing lies to Allah, the Mighty and High. Point out, may Allah\nhave mercy on you, that the correct position regarding Divine Unity is to be found in the\nAttributes of Allah, the Mighty and High, which were revealed in the Qur'an. Do not\napply annulment or anthropomorphism to Allah. He cannot be described by means of\nnegation or anthropomorphism. Allah is the Firm, the Existent. Exalted is Allah from the\ndescriptions of the describers. Do not stray from the Qur'an otherwise you will stray\nafter clarity has reached you. You also asked, may Allah have mercy on you, about\nfaith. Faith is confirmation with the tongue, agreement with the heart, and action with\nthe limbs. Some parts of the faith are interconnected with the others. Sometimes a\nservant can be a Muslim before being faithful [mu'min], but he is never faithful until he\nis a Muslim. Therefore, Islam is before faith and it combines with the faith. Hence, when\na servant commits a major or minor sin, which Allah the Mighty and High, has\nforbidden, then he leaves the circle of faith. He loses the title of faithful, while the tile of\nIslam remains with him. If he repents and seeks forgiveness, he returns to the status of\nfaith, and if he does not return to disbelief and denial. If he says that the permissible is\nforbidden or that the forbidden is permissible, he leaves both the circle of faith and\nIslam, and enters into disbelief. He has the same rank as a man who enters the Holy\nMosque in Mecca, enters the Ka'bah and the Holy Mosque. He is then killed, and goes\nstraight to Hell.",

    "Content": "Muhammad ibn al-Qasim al-Jurjani the Commentator (of the Qur'an) said: Abu Yaqub\nYusuf ibn Muhammad ibn Ziyad; and Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Sayyar, both were\nImami Shiah through their parents, said.\n\nAl-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Muhammad (AS) was asked about the word of Allah, the Mighty\nand High, Bismallah al-Rahman al-Rahim [In the Name of Allah, the Most\nCompassionate, the Most Merciful]. He replied: Allah is He in whom all take refuge in\ntimes of need and difficulty after having lost hope in all but Him, and after having\nbroken relations from all but Him. A person says: In the name of Allah' i.e. I seek help\nin all my affairs from Allah, the Only One worthy of service. He is the Helper when help\nis sought. He is the Answerer when He is called upon. It is also what al-Sadiq (AS) said\nto an man when asked: \"O son of the Messenger of Allah! Those who debate with me\nhave confused me. Guide me to Allah. What is He?\" Hence, he (AS) replied to him, \"O\nservant of Allah! Have you ever ridden a boat? The man said: \"Of course.\" The Imam\n(AS) responded, \"Then did it ever sink, leaving you without a boat to rescue you, and\ninsufficient strength to swim? He answered, \"Yes.\" The Imam (AS) asked, \"At that\nmoment, did you heart have faith in something. All-Powerful that could rescue you from\nyour difficult situation?\" Thus, the man replied, \"Certainly.\" Al-Sadiq (AS) said: \"Then\nthat thing is Allah, the All-Powerful, the One who Rescues when there is no rescuer, and\nthe One who helps when no help is available.\" Al-Sadiq (AS) then added,\nSometimes, some our Shiites forget to begin their action with \"In the Name of Allah, the\nMost Compassionate, the Most Merciful.\" As a result, He tries them with mishaps to\ncaution them to be grateful to Him, the Blessed and Exalted, so that they may praise\nHim, and so that they may learn that it is a mistake to leave out the statement \"In the\nName of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. Al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn\nMuhammad (AS) further said: \"A man stood up before Ali ibn al-Husayn (AS) and\nasked, \"Inform me about the meaning of In the name of Allah, the Most\nCompassionate, the Most Merciful.\" Consequently, Ali ibn al-Husayn (AS) replied,\nMy father related to me, on the authority of his brother, al-Hasan, on the authority of his\nfather, the Commander of the Faithful (AS) that a man stood before him and asked: \"O\nCommander of the Faithful, inform me about the meaning of In the name of Allah, the\nMost Compassionate, the Most Merciful.'\" Thus, he (AS) responded, \"Verily, the word\nAllah' is the greatest of the names of Allah, the Mighty and High. It is a name that\ncannot be given to other than Allah. Creatures are not named by it.\" At that time a man\nenquired that what is the explanation of the word \"Allah?\" The Commander of the\nFaithful (AS) explained, Allah is He in whom all take refuge in times of need and\ndifficulty, after having lost hope in all other but Him, and after breaking ties with all\nother than Him. Regardless of how great, powerful, and wealthy a leader may be in this\nworld, and regardless of how much others depend on him, there will always be things\nover which they leader has no power. Likewise, the leader himself may have needs that\nhe cannot fulfill. Hence, in moments of need, he breaks away from all others, and turns\ntowards Allah until his problem is resolved. And then he returns to his previous\ninfidelity. Do you not hear the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: Say: Tell me if the\nchastisement of Allah should overtake you or the hour should come upon you, will you\ncall (on others) besides Allah, if you are truthful? Nay, Him you call upon, so He\nclears away that for which you pray if He pleases and you forget what you set up\n(with Him). Hence, Allah, the Mighty and High, says to His Servants: O those in need\nof My Mercy, I have indeed compelled you to turn to Me for all your needs, and at all\ntimes, in complete submission. Therefore, rush towards Me for mercy in every endeavor\nyou seek to commence, and which you seek to complete. Verily, if I intend to give you\nsomething, no one has the power to prevent Me. And If I intend to deny you something,\nno one has the power to give it to you. I am the Most Worthy of your supplications, and\nthe Most Worthy of your implorations. Therefore, say at the commencement of every\naction, both small and big: \"In the Name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most\nMerciful\" [Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim], i.e. I seek help in this matter from Allah, the\nSole Worthy of Service. He is the Helper when help is sought. He is the Answerer when\nHe is called upon. He is the Most Compassionate, the Provider of sustenance. He is the\nMost Merciful in this world and the Hereafter. He made this religion easy and simple for\nus. He has shown mercy towards us by distinguishing us from His Enemies. He (AS)\nthen added, The Messenger of Allah (AS) said: Whoever is distressed in pursuit of any\nactivity and says: \"In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful,\"\nsincerely, embracing it in his heart, then one of two outcomes will take place: either his\nwish will be fulfilled in this world, or it will be granted to him by His Lord in the next\nworld. And whatever lies with Allah is better and more permanent for the Believers.",

Among the things Abu Abd Allah (AS)\nsaid to him was: If you claim that \"there is two (gods)\" there can only be three\npossibilities. One: that both gods are eternal and all-powerful. Two: that both gods are\nweak. Or three: that on of them is all-powerful, and the other one is weak. Now, if both\nof them are powerful, then why doesn't one of them overthrow the other, and mange all\naffairs single-handedly? If you believe that one of them is powerful, and the other one\nweak, then you have proved that He is One, and to the apparent inability of the second.\nAnd if you say that \"they are two,\" then only two things are possible: one, that they are\nboth united in all aspects; or two, that they are separate in all aspects.\nHowever, when we contemplate the organization in creation, the orbits of the planets in\nthe celestial sphere, the variation of day and night, the sun and the moon, and how\neverything operate in harmony, everything points that he Manager is One.\nFurthermore, if you claim that there are two gods, there must be a division between\nthem both which has always existed, and that division would have to be a third god.\nHowever, if your claim that there are three gods, then there must be two divisions\nbetween them, leaving us with fie gods, and so on add aeterum.\nHisham said: The dualist then questioned him until he asked, \"What is the proof of His\nExistence?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) replied, \"The existence of great wonders is proof that they were\ncreated by the Creator. When you see the imposing structure of building, you know\ninstinctively that it was built by someone, even though you did not see him build it.\nHe enquired, \"What is He?\"\nThe Imam (AS) explained,\nHe is a thing unlike other things. Consider the word \"a thing\" in order to understand its\nimplication. Since He is Real, and He Exists, He is indeed a Thing. However, He is\ndevoid of both body and image. He is neither sensed nor felt, nor is He perceived by the\nfive senses. The imagination perceives Him not. He is not subject to time. Time has no\neffect upon Him.\nThe questioner asked, \"Therefore, you are saying that Verily, He is All-Hearing, and AllSeeing?\"\nThe Imam (AS) responded,\nHe is All-Hearing, and All-Seeing. He is All-Hearing without tools, and All-Seeing,\nwithout instruments. In fact, He hears by means of His entire being and He hears by His\nentire being. My statement does not mean that \"He hears by means of His Entire Being\"\nin the sense that He is something, and His Being is something else. I am simply using\nthis example in order to answer your question. I say: \"He hears by means of His Entire\nBeing\" and not in the sense that He has parts. Rather, I am attempting to make myself\nunderstood. My only other option would be to say that He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing,\nAllKnowing, and All-Informed, in His Very Essence.\nThe questioner questioned, \"Than what is He?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) answered,\nHe is the Lord. He is the Worshipped One, He is Allah. When I use the word \"Allah,\" I\nam not referring to the combination of the letters \"a,\" \"l,\" and \"h\". Rather, I am pointing\nto its meaning. He is a thing that is the Creator of all Things, and their Manufacturer\nwho is described by means of these letters. He is the one who is referred to by the\nnames Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful, the Honorable, among other\nnames. He is the Worshipped One, the High and mighty.\nThe questioner enquired, \"So anything we can conceive of it created?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) replied:\nIf things were as you claimed, then recognizing Divine Unity would be beyond our\nreach. We are not obliged to believe in what cannot be imagined. However, we say:\neverything we can conceive with our senses is perceived. Therefore, whatever the\nsense can discover and demonstrate is created.\nIn order to prove the existence of the Creator of All Things, we must do so without\nrecurring to two erroneous approaches: the first of which is negation, i.e. abolition\n[ibtal], and non-existence [adam]; and the second is anthropomorphism, i.e. description,\ncomposition [tarkib], and formation [ta'lif]. We cannot prove the existence\nof the Creator on the basis of these two approaches as they are created, The Creator is\nnot like the created. If He resembles the created, then whatever applies to the created\nwould also apply to Him: such as coming into existence after non-existence, growth,\nchange of color, change of strength, and so forth.\nThe questioner said: \"In attempting to prove His Existence, you have limited Him.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) responded, \"I have not limited Him. ON the contrary, I have\ndemonstrated His Existence through the only means possible: assertion and negation.\"\nThe questioner said: \"Is His Existence real and actual?\"\nThe Imam (AS) replied, \"Yes, His Existence is Real as nothing can be prove without\nbeing real and actual.\"\nThe questioner asked, \"Does He have a shape?\"\nThe Imam (AS) explained,\nNo, because shape is description that delineates. We must move away from negation\nand anthropomorphism Whoever negates Him, denies Him, eliminates His Lordship,\nand abolished Him. Whoever compares Him with other things describes Him on the\nbasis of created attributes which are not worthy of Him. Nevertheless, we must prove\nHis Essence without referring to shape. None is worthy of His Essence besides Him.\nAnd no one shares His Essence, encompasses it, or knows it but Him.\nThe questioner said: \"Does He sustain all things by Himself?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) answered, \"He is far Greater than sustaining things directly as only\ncrated being s bring things forth directly. Exalted is He! His Intent and His Will are\neffective. He is the Mighty Doer of whatever He wills.\"\nThe questioner enquired, \"Does He feel pleasure or anger?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said:\nYes. However, His Pleasure and His Anger differ from the pleasure and anger fund\namong crated beings. Among created beings, pleasure and anger cause a change of\nstate which is an attribute of the created, the incapable, and the needy. He is the\nBlessed and Exalted, the Honorable, and the Most Merciful. He is not in need of His\nCreation, while all His Creation is in need of Him. Verily, He created all things by means\nof in",

Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMuhammad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Kufi said: Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Barmaki said: alHusayn ibn al-Hasan said: My father related to me, on the authority of Hannan ibn Sadir that\nI asked Abu Abd Allah (AS) about the Empyrean and the Throne. Hence, he said:\nVerily, the Empyrean has many different meanings which differ on the basis of their\ncontext in the Qur'an. By His Word: The Lord of the great Empyrean, He is that Great\nSovereign. And by His Word: The Most Compassionate God is firm on the Empyrean, He\nencrases by means of His Sovereignty, and this is sovereignty of qualities in\nthings.\nThe connection between the Empyrean and the Throne is unique as they are both\nopenings to the greatest openings of the unseen. Although they are both unseen, they\nare both connected, because the Throne is the apparent opening from which are the\ninnovation and all the things. The Empyrean is the hidden opening in which is found\nthe knowledge of quality, existence, the divine decree, the boundaries, space, will\nintent, knowledge of words, actions, neglect, and the knowledge of the return and the\nbeginning.\nThus, they are both connected openings in knowledge, because the sovereignty of the\nEmpyrean is different from the sovereignty of the Throne, and His Knowledge is more\nunseen than the Knowledge of the Throne. Therefore, it is for this reason that he said: The\nLord of the great Empyrean, i.e. its description is grate than the description of the\nThrone, and they are both connected in that.\"\nI asked, \"May I be your ransom. Why does it share the same merit as the Throne?\"\nHe (AS) replied,\nVerily, it shares in its merit because of the knowledge of quality they both contain.\nHowever, the Throne has the apparent openings of the beginning and its whereabouts, and\nthe limits of contraction and expansion. Therefore, these two are partners: one of them is\nthe carrier of its partner in exchange. It is similar to the exchange of scholars, so they\nmay reason in their claim over the truth of these two, because Allah specifies His Mercy\nto whomever He wills. And He is the Powerful, the Honorable.\nAmong the different descriptions of the Empyrean is that He, the Blessed and Exalted\nsaid: Lord of the Empyrean from what they attribute (to Him). He described the\nEmpyrean of the Oneness, because a group had associated (Him with it), like I\nexplained to you. The Blessed and Exalted said: Lord of the Empyrean, i.e. Lord of the\nOneness from what they attribute.\nA group attributed Him with two hands, so they said: The Hand of Allah is tied up. A\ngroup attributed Him with two feet, and said: \" \"He put His Foot over the rock of the\nSacred House [bayt al-muqaddas], and from there He ascended to heaven.\" A group\nattributed Him with fingertips, and said: \"Verily, Muhammad (SA) said: I found the\ncoolness of His Fingertips on my heart.\" For the likeness of these attributes He said:\nLord of the empyrean from what they attribute (to Him), that Lord of the highest\nexample from what they resemble Him with.\nFor Allah is the highest attribute, which no one resembles, and He cannot be described\nor imagined. That is the highest attribute.\nThe one who have not been given benefits of knowledge, describe their Lord with\nadjectives which are below Him. They anthropomorphise Him and compare Him with\nthat which they are ignorant of. And you have been given only a little portion of\nknowledge. Thus, He has no compeer, no likeness, and no equal.\nAnd Allah's are the best names, with which no one is named but He. These are the ones\nthat He described in the Book, and said: Therefore, call on Him thereby, and leave alone\nthose who violate the sanctity of his names; ignorantly, and without knowledge.\nTherefore, the ones who violate the sanctity of His Names without knowledge, and\ndescribe Him out of ignorance, actually deny Him while thinking that they are doing\ngood deeds. That is why He has said: And most of them do not believe in Allah without\nassociating others (with Him). Hence, they are the ones who violate the sanctity of His\nNames out of ignorance through misplacing His Names.\nO Hannan! Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has commanded to take a group to be\nthe Guardians.' They are the ones Allah has bestowed with merit, and described them\nin terms with which He has not described others. Thus, He sent Muhammad (SA). He\nwas a guide and leader to Allah until he passed away, with the authorization of the\nMighty and High. Then his successor stood in his place as a guide and leader with\nknowledge according to the guidance and command of the Lord.

Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Yaqub\nsaid, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Muhammad ibn Amir, on the authority of Muaalla ibn\nMuhammad that\nThe Learned (AS) was asked: \"How is the knowledge of Allah?\"\nHe (AS) replied,\nHe knows, He wills, He intends, He decrees, He predestines, and He makes to appear.\nTherefore, He exercise what He predestines, He predestines what He decrees, and He\ndecrees what He intends. Thus, through His Knowledge is the Divine Will, through His\nWill is the Intent, through His Intent is the Divine Decree, through His Decree is\npredestination, and through His Predestination is the Exercise of His Will. Therefore,\nthe Knowledge (of Allah) has precedence over the Will (of Allah), the Will (of Allah) is\nsecond, and the Intent (of Allah) is third. The Divine Decree is manifest in\npredestination through the Exercise (of Allah's Will).\nFor Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is the Appearance in whatever He knows, whenever\nHe wills, and in whatever He intends for the decree of the things. Hence, if\npredestination occurs with authorization then there is no appearance. So the\nknowledge of the known exists before it. The Will in the originated is prior to itself. The\nIntent in the intended precedes its existence. The Decree for these known things is\nprior to their detachment and joining, evidently and obviously. Predestination through\nexercise is inescapable from the effective possessors of bodies that can be perceived\nthrough senses like color, smell, weight and measure, and whatever crawls or walks of\nthe humans, the jinn, the birds, the beasts, and other than that which are perceived\nthrough senses.\nTherefore, for Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is the Appearance, of what has no\nexistence, However, if the perceived conceptual existence occurs then there is no\nAppearance. Allah does whatever he wills, and through His Knowledge He knows all\nthings prior to their existence. Through the Divine Will He identifies their attributes and\nlimits; and originate them before their disclosure. Through the Intent He differentiates\nthem in their colors, attributes and limits. Through the Divine Decree He decrees their\ntimes, and knows their beginning and their end. Through Predestination He manifested\nthe places of mankind and led them to these. Through the Exercise of His Will He\nexplained their reasons for being, and manifested their mattes. That is the decree of the\nHonorable, the All-Knowing.\nMuhammad ibn Ali the Compiler of this book, may Allah help him in His obedience,
says: The Appearance is not the way the ignorant think, namely, that He appears to
regret. Exalted is Allah from that. However, it is mandatory upon us to confirm with
Allah, the Mighty and High, that He has the power of Appearance. The meaning of that
is: Verily, it is for Him to start something from His Creation to create it before
something, and then that thing becomes nonexistent, and He begins with something
other than it. Or He orders to do something then stops from doing it, or orders to stop
from something, then orders to do what He had stopped.\nThe examples of that would be the abrogation of previous Shariahs (to Islam),\nchanging of the direction of Qiblah, and the prescribed period [iddat] of a woman\nwhose husband has passed away. Allah does not command His Servants for a matter\nin a specified time except when He knows that it is in their interest in that time. And He\nknows that in another time their interest is in stopping them from the like of which He\ncommanded them to do. Therefore, in all times He commands them for what is in their\ninterest. Thus, whoever confirms for Allah, the Mighty and High, that for Him is to do\nwhat He wills, to destroy what He wills, to create in its place what He wills, to advance\nwhat He wills, to retard what He wills, to command what He wills and how He wills, to\ncommand what He wills and how He wills, then he has confirmed the doctrine of the\nAppearance.\nAllah, the Mighty and High, has not revered anything better than the confirmation that\nfor Him is the creation, the command, advancement, and to retard and establishing\nwhat does not exist, and to destroy what does exist. The belief in the Appearance is a\nrejection of the Jews, because they said: Verily, Allah concluded the affair. Hence, we\nsaid: Verily, Allah is in a new manifestation everyday. He gives life, and He kills. He\ngives sustenance, and does what He wills. The Appearance is not from regret. It is\ncertainly manifestation of a matter. The Arabs say: A man appeared in my way' i.e.\nmanifested. Allah, the Mighty and High said: And there shall appear to them from Allah\nthat which they had not been expecting, i.e. become plain to them.\nWhenever Allah, Exalted be His Remembrance, observes that a servant observes the\nties of kinship, He increases his life; and whenever He observes that a servant severs\nthe ties of kinship, He decreases his life. Whenever Allah observes that a servant\nfornicates, He reduces his life. Whenever Allah observes that a servant fornicates, He\nreduces his sustenance and shortens his life; and whenever he observes that a servant\nis chaste, He increases his sustenance and lengthens his life.",

Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qittan and Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) both said: Ahmad ibn Yahya said: Bakr ibn Abd Allah ibn Hubayb said: Muhammad ibn Ubayd Allah related to me that Ali ibn al-Hakam said: Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Aswad said, on the authority of Jafar ibn Muhammad (AS), on the authority of his father (AS) The Messenger of Allah (SA) had two Jewish friends who believed in Musa, the Messenger of Allah (AS). They used to come to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (SA) and listen to him. They both had read the Torah, the scriptures of Ibrahim and Musa (AS), and had knowledge of previous books. When Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, made His Messenger (SA) die, they both came asking for the one vested authority after him, and said: \"Verily, a prophet does not die but he leaves behind a Caliph who executes all affairs in his Ummah after him, who is the closet to him in relation from his Household, of great significance and high prestige.\" Then one of them asked his companion, \"Do you know who is vested with authority after this Prophet (SA)?\" The other one replied, \"I do not know him except for the description which I have found in the Torah that he will bald and pale. Verily, he is the closest of the people to the Messenger of Allah.\" Thus, when they both entered medina, and asked about the Caliph, they were guided to Abu Bakr. When they looked at him they both said: \"This is not our Companion.\" Then they asked him, \"What is your relationship with the Messenger of Allah (SA)?\" He answered, \"Verily, I am a man from his family. He was the husband of my daughter, A\\'ishah.\" They both enquired, \"Is there any other relationship?\" He responded, \"No.\" They both said: \"This is not the relationship. Inform us, where is your Lord?\" He replied, \"Above the seven heavens.\" They responded, \"Do you have anything else to add?\" He said: \"No\" They said: \"Lead us to the one who is more learned than you. For verily, you are not the man we find described in the Torah who is successor of this Prophet and his Caliph.\" Abu Bakr became furious as a result of their statement and got up. Then he guided them to Umar. This was because Abu Bakr knew that if they confronted Umar, he would surely hit them. Hence, when they appeared to Umar, they asked, \"What is your relationship with this Prophet (SA)?\" He answered, \"I am from his family, and he was the husband of my daughter Hafsah.\" They both asked, \"Is there any other relationship?\" He responded, \"No.\" They both said: \"This is not the relationship that we seek to establish. It is not the description which we find the Torah.\" Then they asked him, \"Where is your Lord?\" He replied, \"Above the seven heavens.\" They asked, \"Do you have anything else to add?\" He said: \"No.\" They both said: \"Take us to the one who is more learned than you.\"Hence, he guided them to Ali, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. When they both arrived in his presence and looked at him, one of them said to his companion, \"Verily, he is the man whom we find described in the Torah. He is the successor of this Prophet (SA), his Caliph, husband of his daughter, father of the two grandsons [sibtayn] and father of the Riser [qa'im] who will come with the Truth after him,\" Then they asked Ali (AS), \"O man! What is your relationship to the Messenger of Allah?\" He (AS) replied \"He was my brother. I am his heir, his successor, the first to believe in him, and the husband of his daughter Fatimah (AS).\" They said to him, \"This is the closest and most perfect relationship. This is the description which we find in the Torah.\" Then they asked him, \"Where is your Lord, the Mighty and High?\" Ali, blessings and salutations be upon him, replied to them, \"If the two of you desire, I could inform you about the life of your Prophet Musa (AS), and if you desire, I could inform you about the life of our Prophet Muhammad (SA).\" They said: \"Inform us of the lifetime of our Prophet Musa (AS).\" Ali (AS) responded, Four angels came; an angel from the east, an angel from the West, an angel from the Heaven, and an angel form (below) the Earth. Then the one from the east asked the one from the west, \"Where have you come from?\" He said: \"I have come form my Lord.\" The one from the west asked the one from the east, \"Where have you come from?\" He replied, \"I have come from my Lord.\" The one who came down from the Heaven asked the one which came out from the Earth. \"Where have you come from?\" He answered, \"I have come from my Lord. And the one which came out form the Earth asked the one which came down form Heaven, \"Where have you come from?\" He said: \"I have come from y Lord.\" This took place during the lifetime of your Prophet Musa (AS), and as for what was in the lifetime of our Prophet Muhammad (SA), then that is His word in His Decisive Book: Nowhere is there a secret counsel between three persons but He is the fourth of them, nor (between) five but He is the sixth of them nor less than that nor more but He is with them where so ever they are.\" The two Jewish men enquired, \"Then what has stopped your two companions from putting you in the place which you deserve? We swear by the One who revealed the Torah to Musa (AS): Verily, you are the True Caliph. We find your description in our Book, and we read it in our synagogues. Verily, you are more worth of this affair and more entitled to it than the one who has snatched it away from you.\" Ali (AS) replied, \"The two of them preceded themselves and obstructed me. Their accountability is with Allah, the Mighty and High. They will be stopped and questioned (on the Day of Judgment).\"",

"Content": "1. Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Majilwayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim said, on the authority of al-Mukhtar ibn Muhammad ibn al-Mukhtar al-Hamdani said, on the authority of al-Fath ibn Yazid al-Jurjani, that I heard Abu al-Hasan al-Rida (AS) say: He is the Subtle, the All-Aware, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the One, the Unique, the Needless, who begets not nor is begotten, and there is none like unto Him. He is the Producer of all Things, the Former of Bodies, and the Maker of Images. If He was as they say, then the Creator would not be distinguished from the created, nor the Producer from the production. However, He is the Producer. The difference between Him and bodes and images I that he created them, and there is nothing like unto Him. I asked, \"By all means. May Allah make me your ransom! However, you said: The Alone, the Needless' and you also said: He is not like anything.' If Allah is One, and man is one, are they not similar in unity?\" He (AS) replied, O Fath! You paid attention, may Allah secure you! Verily, the similarity is limited to meaning. Identifiers are merely means of identifying the identified. If it is said that there is one man, it means that there is one body, as opposed to two. However, although we say that man is one, he is not truly one, as he has different body parts and different colors. Although we say that he is one, he is composed of many different parts which are not he same. His blood is other than his flesh, his flesh is other than his blood, his nerves are other than his veins, his hair is other than his skin, and the darkness of his skin is other than the paleness of his skin. Likewise is the rest of creation. Thus, the human being is \"one\" in name, but he is other than \"one\" in meaning. Not only is Allah, lofty be His Majesty, One in name, He is also One in meaning as there is none other than Him. There is no variation in Him, no contrast, nor any increase or decrease. As a crated being, the human being is composed of different parts and substances. H e is one \"one\" in combination. I enquired: \"You have relieved me. May Allah relieve you! As for your statement: The Subtle, All-Aware,' could you explain it to me as you explained to me the meaning of the One.' I really need to know how His Subtlety is different from the subtlety of His Creation. I would surely appreciate it if you could explain that to me.\" Therefore, he (AS) answered: O Fath! We had said: He is the Subtle due to the delicate nature of His Creation, and for His Knowledge of tiny things. Do you not see, may Allah help you and secure you, the effect of His Making in soft and hard plants? And do you not see in the delicate creation of tiny insects like the mosquito, the gnat, and that which is smaller than these two, and are almost not evident to the (naked) eyes? In fact, due to their small size, it is virtually impossible to differentiate between the male and the female, and between the young and the old. Thus, we come to know that the Creator is Subtle in His Creation when we see the smallness of creatures in their refinement, their guidance out of decay, and their fleeing from death. We come to know that the Creator is Subtle when we contemplate the creatures found teeming in the depths of the ocean, on the branches of trees, and in the deserts and barren lands. We come to know the Creator is Subtle when we contemplate how species communicate with one another using various forms of communication, permitting them to communicate with their offspring. We come to know that the Creator is Subtle when we contemplate how creatures provide food to their offspring, and how they are distinguished by colors, red with yellow, white with red, and with what we can barely see with our eyes due to its small size. We come to know that the Creator is Subtle when we contemplate the creatures that our eyes cannot see and our hands cannot touch. He created the world in subtlety without planning, without instruments, and without tools. Verily, the founder of anything founded it on the basis of another. However, Allah, the Creator, the Subtle, and the Sublime, created everything out of nothing.",

{
"Content": "2. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Yaqub alKulayni said: Ali ibn Muhammad, said, on the authority Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Khalid that Abu al-Hasan al-Rida (AS) said: May Allah bestow upon you knowledge of what is good! Know that Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is Eternal. Eternity is an attribute through which the wise understand that there was nothing before Him in eternity, and that there is nothing alongside Him in eternity. Even the common folk acknowledge that nothing existed before Allah, and that nothing exists alongside Him. At the same time, it invalidates the claim that there was something before Him. Had there been something eternal along with Him. He would not have been the Creator of that thing. If something existed along with Him, how then would He have been its Creator? Had there been something existing before Him, then that thing would have been worthier of being His Creator because it existed before Him. The blessed and Exalted ascribed certain names to Himself. When He created his creatures, He enabled them to serve Him, and told His creatures to call Him by those names. He called Himself the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Riser ]qaim], the Manifest, the Hidden, the Subtle, the All-Aware, the Powerful, the Honorable, the All-Wise, and the All-Knowing, among other similar names. When the lying exaggerators [ghalun] heard us talk about such names, that there is nothing similar to Him, and that none of the creatures are like unto Him, they said: \"When you say that there is nothing like unto Him, and nothing is similar to Him, then how can you share with Him His Most Beautiful Names, and apply them to yourselves? Thus, this is proof that you are similar to Him in all conditions or in some conditions because you share the same purified names.\" It is said to them: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has named His Servants with some of His own Names but with differences in meaning just like one name may have two different meanings. The proof of this can be found among he common people. This is the way in which Allah, the Mighty and High, has addressed the creation. He has spoken to them by means of things that they understand so that the will have no excuse for their misdeeds. A man is sometimes called a dog, a donkey, a bull or a lion just like he can be called sweet or bitter. All of these words are used with a n allegorical meaning which differs from their literal meaning. A man cannot literally be a lion or a dog. Please pay close attention to this, May Allah have mercy on you! Verily, we say that Allah is All-Knowing, and not that He crated knowledge. It does not mean that He uses his Knowledge in order to record His Future Commands or His Process of Creation and Destruction because had that knowledge not been present that would imply ignorance or weakness. Likewise, the learned among creation are called knowledgeable because they possess created knowledge, which they did not have at some time in the past. They may lose their knowledge at some point and become ignorant again. However, Allah is called All-Knowing because He is not ignorant of anything. Thus, the Creator and the created are both called knowing, but the meaning is different as you have noticed.Our Lord is called All-Hearing. However, this is not through a body part or sensory organ without which He could not hear the sound as is the case with us. We cannot see with the part with which we hear. However, He has told us that no sound is hidden from Him. His hearing is not limited, as it is in our case. Here again the name hearing is used in both cases, but its meaning is different. The same applies for seeing. He does not see by means of an eye as we do. We see using a body part which serves that sole purpose. However, Allah is All-Seeing, and is never unaware of any individual. Again, the same name is used in both cases, but its meaning is different. He is Standing, but not in the sense of standing of His Les as would be the case for other beings. However, He informed us that He is Sanding, and that He is the Guardian. This is like the saying \"A man is standing behind our affairs.\" He is Standing behind every soul watching what is gains. As used by people, the word \"standing\" also has meanings like sufficing.' As you may say to a man, \"Stand up for the affairs of so and so\" which means to deal with them in a sufficient manner. Standing for us means that we stand on our legs. Therefore, the name is similar but its meaning is different. As for the term Subtle, it is Subtle, it is not used in the sense of smallness or being infinitesimal. Rather, it is used to express how difficult it is to perceive things. As an example, it may be said: \"It has become very delicate for me,\" and that \"so and so is very delicate in his manners and dealings.\" This means that it is profound for the intellect, and it is very difficult to understand. It has become so delicate that it cannot even be perceived by means of the imagination. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is far more Subtle than to be comprehended through definitions or be limited by an attribute in the way we are subtle, small and delicate. Names can be the same but they can differ in meaning. As for the All-Aware, it means that He is the One who Knows all Things, Completely, but not through study or experience, without which He would know nothing. One without experience and training is ignorant. Allah is always All-Aware of what He ha created. The people who are well are those people who are learning to overcome their ignorance. Thus, names are the same but again, they differ in meaning. As for the Manifest, it does not mean that He is over and above all things or sitting on the uppermost part of them. Rather, it refers to His Dominion and His Power over All Things. An example of this would be when a person says, \"I overcame my enemies\" or that \"Allah granted me victory over my enemies.\" In this case, there is a report of failure and victory. Thus, this shows Allah's Dominion over all enemies.Another illustration that He is Manifest is that for those who intend Him, nothing is hidden form Him, and He is the Planner of all that can be seen. What can be clearer or more manifest than Allah, the Exalted? No matter where you look, His Presence will never vanish. Even within you, His Traces are sufficient proof for His Existence. However, what is manifested in us is apparent, and its limits are known. Therefore, the names are thee same, but their meanings differ. As for the Hidden, it does not mean that He is inside things. Rather, it refers to His Inner Knowledge of all things from their planning to their preserving. As one may say, \"I tried to get to the inside of the matter,\" that is, \"I came to learn and discover his secrets.\" For us, what is hidden is what is unseen and covered. Once again, the names are the same, but they differ in meaning. As for the Subduer, it does not refer to plotting, using certain devices, speaking seductive words, or using cunning means as some people do to subdue one another. The victorious among the people may become subdued, and vice versa. However, for Allah, the Blessed and Exalted,, all creatures are weak. Due to the absence of obstacles in what He wills for them, it takes less than a blinking of the eye for Him to say \"Be and it is.\" Subduing in our case is how I mentioned and explained. Thus, names are alike but their meanings differ. That is the case for all the names, although we have not mentioned all of them. We will suffice with this for learning purpose. May Allah be our Helper and your Helper assuring our guidance and success!",

Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Yaqub said: Ali ibn Muhammad said, on the authority of Salih ibn Abu Hammad, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Yazid, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Abu Hamzah, on the authority of Ibrahim ibn Umar that Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, created names by letters and He, the Mighty and High, cannot be described by letters. He cannot be uttered by words, cannot be embodied in person, cannot be described by anthropomorphism, and cannot be colored by colors. Regions are negated from Him. Limits are far from Him. The sense of every imaginer is covered from Him. He is understood and not hidden. Hence, He has made it a complete word in four parts altogether. Neither one of them precedes the other. Then he showed three of those names to creation out of their need for them, and hid one of them. That is the well-kept threasure name through which these names were manifested. Thus, the apparent is Allah, the Blessed and Exalted. He, glory be to Him, utilized each one of the four first principles, and that became twelve principles. Then He created for each of the principles thirty names, in effect, related to them. They are the Most Compassionate, the most Merciful, the Sovereign, the Most Holy, the Creator, the Maker [al-Bari'], the Imager, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsistent [al-Qayyum], slumber seized Him not, nor does sleep, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware, the All-Hearing, the all-Seeing, the Most Wise, the Honorable, the Supreme, the Possessor of all Greatness [al-Mutakabbir], the Most High, the Most Great, the All-Powerful [al-Muqtadir], the Omnipotent, the Giver of Peace [al-Salam], the Granter of Security [al-Mumum], the Guardian over All [alMuhaymin], the Maker, the Producer, the Originator [al-Badi'], the Lofty [al-Rafi]. The Sublime, Generous, the Sustainer, the Giver of Life, the Causer of Death, the Raiser [al-Baith], and the Inheritor. These are the names, among which are the Most Beautiful Names, until 360 names are complete. Thus, these are related to the three names. These three names are the first principles, and concealment for the Well-Kept threasure name by these three names. As we read in the Word of the Mighty and High: Say, call upon Allah or call upon the Most Compassionate Allah; whichever you call upon, He has the best names.",

He is Himself, and His Self is He. His Power was effective and He did not need to call Himself. However, He chose names for Himself so that He could be called upon, because unless He is called upon by His Name, there is no way for Him to be known. Therefore, the first name He chose for Himself was the Most High, the Most Great [al-Ali al-Azim], because He is Higher than all things. Hence, His meaning is Allah, and His Name is the Most High, the Most Great. That is among His first names, because He is High, Higher than Everything.",

The identifier is other than the identified, and is thus created, with the exception of Allah. Anything which is uttered by tongues or written by hands is created. Allah is the destination of all those who seek to reach Him. The aimer is other than the aimed. The aimed is described, and everything which is described is created. The Creator of All Things is not described with the limit of the named. He is not formed so that His Form could be compared to the created. Anything which is intended is other than Him. He is never disregarded by whoever understands this conclusion and that is pure Tawhid. Thus, listen to Allah, accept Him, and try to understand Him with His permission. Whoever claims that he has recognized Allah through concealing or revealing an image or the like, is a polytheist, because anything concealed or revealed is other than Him. Verily, He is One United Being. Therefore, how can one profess a belief in Divine Unity when one recognizes Him by other than Him? Only he has recognized Allah who recognizes Him by Allah (Himself). Thus, whoever does not recognize Him by Himself has not recognized Him, and certainly has recognized other than Him. There is nothing between the Creator and the created. Therefore, Allah is the creator of all things and is not from a thing. He is named by His Names and, hence, He is other than His Names, and the names are other than Him.",

"Content": "7. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Kufi said: Muhammad ibn Bishr related to me, on the authority of Abu Hashim al-Jafari that I was with Abu Jafar the Second (AS), when a man asked him, \"Inform me about the Lord, the Blessed and Exalted. There are names and attributes for Him in His Book. Are those His Only Names and attributes?\" Consequently, Abu Jafar (AS) replied, Verily, there are two interpretations to your question. If you are referring to quantity, then Exalted is Allah from such limitations. However, if you wanted to know whether these attributes and names have always existed, then there are two possibilities. Either they have always been part of His Knowledge, and He has always deserved them, and this is true. However, if you want to now whether the image of these attributes and names, their alphabets, and their form, have always been there, then may Allah save me from the claim that something has existed alongside Him. In fact, Allah existed when no creation existed. Then He created the names as a means for His Creation to beseech Him and serve Him. They are the means through which He is remembered. Allah was there when no remembrance existed. The One who is Remembered is Allah, the Eternal, who has always existed. The Names and Attributes are creation of meanings. What is meant by them is that Allah is not subject to agreement or disagreement, since only one with parts disagrees or agrees. Hence, it is not said: Allah agreed, nor that Allah is more or less. However, He is Eternal in His Essence, because whatever is other than One has parts, and Allah is the One without Parts. He cannot be imagines as less, nor can he be imagines as more. Anything composed of parts, and which can be conceived as less or conceived as more, was created by a Creator Thus, when you say that \"Verily, Allah is Omnipotent\" you are affirming that nothing incapacitates Him. Therefore, you have negate the word: \"incapable,\" and applied it to other than Him. Likewise, by your use of the word: \"All-Knowing\" you have indeed negated ignorance and related ignorance to other than Him. When Allah causes all things to perish, He will cause images and alphabets to perish. Nevertheless, He, who has always been All-Knowing, will never expire or decline. The man asked, \"How can our Lord be called the All-Hearing?\" He (AS) answered, That is because nothing which is understood by means of hearing is hidden form Him. We do not claim that He hears through ears. Likewise, when we call Him All-Seeing, we say so because nothing visual is hidden from Him: be it colors, people, or other objects. We do not claim that He sees through eyes. We call Him the Subtle One due to His knowledge of subtle things like the mosquito, and for His Knowledge of creatures which are even smaller than that. We call Him the subtle One because of His Knowledge of the place of their division, their thoughts, their needs, their reproductive cycle, their affection for offspring, their means of communication, their bringing of food and drink to their offspring in the mountains, deserts, valleys, and wastelands (of the worlds). We come to know that the Creator of these things is the Subtle One without quality. Verily, quality applies only to the created. Our Lord is called the Powerful One, but not with the same type of power found among created beings. If His Power were like the power found among created beings, then He would be compared to His Creation, and He would be susceptible to both increase and decrease and could not be Eternal. Whatever is not eternal is powerless. Thus, our Lord, the Blessed and Exalted, has no compeer [shibh], no opponent, no equal, no quality, no end, and no regions. The mind is incapable of conceiving Him, the imagination is incapable of limiting Him, and the conscience is incapable of placing conditions on Him. He is Higher than the implements of His Creation and characteristics of His Creatures. Exalted is He, the Elevated and Great, from such things!",

"Content": "9. Ahmad ibn Ziyad ibn Jafar al-Hamdani (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim said on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu al-Salt Abd al-Salam ibn Salih al-Harawi, on the authority of Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS), on the authority of his father (AS), on the authority of his forefathers (AS), on the authority of Ali (AS) that The Messenger of Allah (SA) said: \"For Allah, the Mighty and High, are Ninety-Nine Names. Whoever calls Allah by them, He will grant him what he asks. And whoever enumerates them shall enter Paradise.\" Muhammad ibn Ali al-Husayn, the Compiler of this book explains: The meaning of the statement of the Prophet, praise and salutations of Allah be upon him and his Progeny, is that indeed Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, the has Ninety-Nine names. Whoever enumerates them will enter Paradise. Enumerating the names means to encompass them, and understand their meanings. The meaning of enumerating them is not simply to count them or to number them. All success depends upon Allah. Allah, God [Allah, al-Ilah], Allah and Ilah means the worthy of service, and no one has the right to be served but Him. You may say: He was One God in the sense that He had the right to be served. This is why, when the infidels went astray, and determined that the worshipping idols is mandatory, they names them gods [al-ihah]. Its origin is al-ilahah, that is service (worship). It is said: Its origin is al-ilah, it si said; aliha al-rajul ya'lahu ilayh i.e. he took refuge to it fro an affair that afflicted him. Alihahu i.e. he aided him. The explanation of the Imam's (AS) statement is as follows: Then two As' [hamzahs] had combined in one word, due to a common use of the word, and its heavy pronunciation, the original A' [Hamzah] was omitted, because they found in the shortened word sounded similar to its full form. Then the two Ls' [lam] were combined, the first of the two did not contain a vowel, so they assimilated it into the second. Thus, it became a doubled letter in your word: Allah [Allah]. The One, the Alone [al-Wahid, al-Ahad], the meaning of al-Ahad is that He is One in His Essence, not possessing parts, components, and limbs. Nor is it permissible to number Him and ascribe change to Him, because change in things is evidence of His Oneness, which applies only to Him. It is said: Allah has always been One. The second meaning is that He is One, there is no equal to Him. Therefore, no one shares with Him the meaning of Oneness, because all those that have equals and likes are not one in reality. It is also said: he is one of a kind, i.e. there is no equal to him in what he is attributed with. Allah is One, but not numerically, because He, the Mighty and High, is not counted among the genus, but He is One, there is no equal to Him. Some of the philosophers have said about the One and the Alone: Verily, it has been said: He is One, because He is Solitary and He is the First, because He has no second. Then He originate all the creation in need of each other. The numerical \"one\" has nothing before it. In fact, it comes before all numbers. However way you perceive it or divide it, nothing increases or decreases the number one. When you say: one divided by one equals one, nothing increases it, and the word does not change from one. Therefore, the number one indicates that nothing came before Him. Thus, if it indicates that nothing came before Him, it indicates that He is the One that brought things about. If He is the One that brought things about, it indicates that He is the destroyer of Things. If He is the Destroyer of things, then it indicates that nothing is after Him. Hence, if there is nothing before Him, and nothing after Him, then He is the Solitary sempiternally. This is why it is said: the One, the Alone. There are certain characteristics of the Alone [al-Ahad] that are not present in the One [al-Wahid]. You may say: There is not any one [Wahid] in the house. It can mean that there is no animal, no bird, no beast, or no human in the house. Therefore, the number one can refer to people or other than people. However, when you say there is no one [Ahad] in the house, it is limited to human beings, and others are excluded. The Unique cannot be subject to multiplication, number, division, and calculation. It is Alone in Uniqueness. The number one, however, can be subject to the shortcomings of numbers, divisions, and calculations. You can say: one, two, three... and these are numbers. They number one, however, is the cause of numbers, is outside of numbers, and is not a number. For example, one can say: one multiplied by two or three, or any higher numerals. Thus, this is multiplication. And you may say: two divided by one... Hence, this is division. However, the Alone cannot be subjected to arithmetic. Hence, it cannot be said: along [Ahad], two, nor alone divided by one... It is neither said: alone divided by two... The Needless [al-Samad], its meaning is the Master. Whoever accepts this meaning then it is permissible for him to say: He has always been the Needless [Samad]. It is said that nobody administers the affairs of the nation but the ruling authority who is obeyed [Samad]. AS a poet has said: I lifted my sword (to take his life) then said to him Take it, O Hudhayfa, as you are the master who is obeyed [Samad] There is another meaning for the Samad and that is the objective in the needs. It is said: I seek him. However, whoever accepts this meaning, then it is not permissible for him to say: He has always been the Objectie [samad], because he has attributed Himj, the Mighty and High, with an attribute from the Attributes of Action. This meaning is also correct. Samad has neither a body nor an interior. I have explained other meanings of Samad in the Commentary of Chapter 112 of the Quran in this Book, which I do not wish to repeat in this chapter. The First, the Last [al-Awwal, al-Akhir], their meanings are that He is the First without a beginning, and the Last without an end. The All-Hearing [al-Sami], the meaning of this is that if anything audible is found then He is its Hearer. The other meaning is that He is the Listener of the prayer i.e. answerer of the prayer. In order to be Hearing [Sami], sound needs to exist. Hence, it is not permissible to say that Hearing is an attribute of His Essence, Mighty be His Name. The All-Seeing [al-Basir], the meaning of this is that if there is anything that can be seeing, then He perceives it. This is why it is permissible to say: He has always been All-Seeing. While it is not permissible to say: He has always been made to see [mubsir], because that is transitive, and requires existence. The word \"perception\" [basarah] is literally a root-word for All-Seeing [basir], and [basura]. Allah, the Mighty and High, is All-Seeing in His Essence. We have not attributed for Him, the Blessed and Exalted, that He is All-Hearing, and All-Seeing, as an attribute that He is All-Knowing (of the two), but what we have stated intends that He perceives. This is a characteristic of all living beings, and there is no calamity in it. The Omnipotent, the Subduer [al-Qadir, al-Qahir], the meaning of these two is that things are unable to refuse His Will. It is said: Verily, the Omnipotent is one from whom any action is possible, so long as it is not impossible. To subdue [qahr] is to overpower [ghalabah]. Omnipotence [qudrah] is a root-word in the statement: he possessed power i.e. controlled [malaka]. Therefore, He is the Omnipotent [qadir], the All-Powerful [qadir], and the Potent [muqtadir]. His Omnipotence extends even to what does not exist and His Potency is present at His Innovation, namely, His Power and His Sovereignty over it. He, Mighty be His Remembrance, has said: Master of the Day of Judgment. The Day of Judgment does not yet exist. It is said: Verily, He, the Mighty and High, has always been the Subduer. The meaning of this is that things do not have the capability of refusal to Him and to what He intends to execute in them. He has always been the Potent over them even when they did not exists, like it is said: Master of the Day of Judgment, while the Day of Judgment does not exist yet. The Most High, the Most Sublime [al--Ali, al-Ala], the meaning of al-Ali is the Subduer. Therefore, Allah is the Subduer, Possessor of Highness [dhu al-Ula], Loftiness [al-Ala] and Elevation [al-Taali] i.e. Omnipotent. It is said: the king is exalted in might. It is also said for everything that is lofty: it was high, it will be elevated, it is lofty, it will be lofty... The word al-Malat is derived from al-Maali and literally means to acquire nobility. The ilw of everything is its higher part: so and so is a prominent figure in people [ilyat al-nas] and it is a noun. The meanings of elevating, ascending, and descending, do no apply to Allah, the Blessed and Exalted. The other meaning is that He, Exalted is He, is above resemblances, equals, whatever goes into a subject, whatever the ignorant image, and what spontaneous thought. Therefore, He, the elevated and Great, is More Lofty [Mutaalin] than what the oppressors say. As for the Most Sublime [al-Ala], its meaning is the Most High, and the Subduer. The Word of the Mighty and High to Musa endorses this: Fear not, surely you shall be the uppermost, i.e. the subduer. Also the Word of the Mighty and High in inciting the Believers to combat: And be not infirm, and be not grieving, and you shall have the upper hand [al-a'lawn] if you are Believers. And the Word of the Mighty and High: Surely Fir'awn exalted himself in the land, i.e. overpowered them and captured them. A poet has said in this meaning: Thus, when we overpowered and captured them, We left them on the ground for the vultures and birds of prey. The second meaning is that He is Lofty i.e. unblemished from resemblances and equals, like He says: Exalted is He far above what they associate (with Him). The Ever-Remaining [al-Baqi], its meaning is the Being who has not come about, and who will never perish. Remaining is contrary to perishing... It is said: nothing remains of them, and Allah did not preserve anything of them. The Everlasting is one of His Attributes. He is also the Ever-Remaining, who does not become extinct, nor perish. The Originator [al-Badi], its meaning is Creator of Original Creations, and Inventor of the Things without prior example and imitation. Grammatically, it belongs to the nominal type (on the scale of) fail in the meaning of active participle mufil, like in the word of the Mighty and High: A painful chastisement [adhabun alim], while the meaning is not receiving pain, but rather giving pain. The Arabs say: He hit (receiving pain), and he hit (causing pain) A poet said: Is he a good reader and listener? Who wakes me and my friends while we are peacefully sleeping? Therefore, the meaning of listening would be listener. The origin [bid] of a thing is the first of it. As we read in the Word of the Mighty and High: Say: I am not the first [bidan] of the messengers, i.e. not the first. Al-Bidat also applies to first or innovations in matters of religion, etc. A poet said: Your palms are not created for generosity. And their miserliness is not something new. Hence, one fist is clenched from good Like it has decreased from a hundred to seven. Whereas the other one has three thousand And nine hundred as a habit. It is also said: You have come up with an original matter, i.e. amazing invention. The Maker [al-Bari'], its meaning is that He is the Maker of Creatures, i.e. the Creator of the Creations. He made them, i.e. He created the. The creature is creation. Most of the Arabs avoid the last vowel (the [] sound at its end). It is an active participle with the sense of a passive participle, and some of them have said: it is taken from \"shaping the wood,\" some claim that it is form al-Bary, which is dust, i.e. He has created them from dust, and they say: This why it does not contain the vowel at its end. The Most Generous [al-Akram], its meaning is al-Karim. Sometimes the elative expresses the meaning of the nominal type, like the Word of the Mighty and High: And it is easier [ahwan] to Him, i.e. it is easy [hayyin] to Him. Like the Word of the Mighty and High: None shall enter it but the most unhappy [al-ashqa], and His Word: And away from it shall be kept the one who guards most [al-atqa] (against evil), what is meant by the most unhappy, and the one who guards against what is adverse [al-shaqi], and one who guards [al-taqi]. A poet has said: Verily, the One who created the heaven as a roof for us Created a house with taller, more powerful, pillars, for us. The Manifest [al-Zahir], its meaning is that He is manifest through His Signs, in which He has concealed witnesses of His Omnipotence, traces of His Wisdom, and evidence of His Clear Proof. The created are unable to create the most insignificant of it. Like Allah, the Mighty and High, says: Surely those whom you call upon besides Allah cannot create a fly, though they should al gather for it. Therefore, there is nothing in His Creation that does not profess His Unity. The Blessed and Exalted avoided describing His Essence. Hence, He is manifested through His signs and Witnesses of His Omnipotence. He is Predominant, and All-Powerful over whatever He wills. This is found in the Word of the Mighty and High: And they became uppermost, i.e. predominant over them. The Hidden [al-Batin], its meaning is that He is Hidden from Imagination. Therefore, He is Hidden without Encompassment. Nothing encompasses Him, because He has been there prior to the thoughts. Hence, thoughts are subject to Him. The Known has preceded everything and cannot be encompassed. Imaginations pas away; hence, they cannot explore Him. Therefore, He is the Hidden of all Hidden and the Covered of all Covered. He is Hidden in His Essence, and manifest and Lofty in His signs. Consequently, He is the Hidden without any cover and Manifest without any approximation. The other meaning of this is that He is the Interior [batin] of everything i.e. All-Aware and All-Seeing of what they keep secret and what they disclose, and of whatever is sowed and created. The entourage [batanat] of a man is composed of people he trusts with his personal affairs. The meaning is that He is All-Knowing of their secrets, not that He, the Mighty and High, hides in a thing disguising in it. The Ever-Living [al-Hai], its meaning is that He is the Mighty Doer [al-Faal] and the Director [al-Mudabbir]. He is Ever-Living by His Own Accord. Death and annihilation are impossible for Him. He does not need life in order to live. The All-Wise [al-Hakim], its meaning is that He is all-Knowing. The wisdom is literally the knowledge. As we read in the Word of the Mighty and High: He grants wisdom to whom He pleases, (i.e. He grants knowledge). The second meaning is that He is Precise [Muhkam], and His actions are firm and free from corruption. Hakamtuhu (I commanded him) and ahkamtuhu (I planned the action precisely) are two literal words. A part of horse's bridle [Hakamah] is named by such, because it stops a sever blow, and it is what encompasses its mouth. The Omniscient [al-Alim], its meaning is that He is All-Knowing by Himself. He is All-Knowing of secrets and All-Informed of minds. The littlest of the things is not hidden from Him, nor can the weight of an atom escape from Him. He knows things before they take pale and after He brings them about. He knows what they do in secret, and what they do in public. He knows what is apparent, and what is hidden. The Mighty and High's knowledge of things is unlike the creatures' knowledge. Thus, it stands to reason that He, the Blessed and Exalted, is dissimilar from them in every sense. Allah is omniscient in His Essence. The Omniscient is the Cause of Firm and Accurate Action. Therefore, it is not said: Verily, He knows things through knowledge; just as nothing eternal exist alongside Him. In fact, it is said: Verily, He is Omniscient by Essence. Thus, such is said in all of His Attributes of Essence. The Forbearing [al-Halim], the meaning of this is that He is Forbearing of whoever disobeys Him. He does not hasten in His Punishment. The Protector [al-Hafiz], al-hafiz is al-hafiz, that is nominal type of the active participle. Its meaning is that He protects things and averts from them tribulation. He cannot be attributed with protecting in the sense of learning, because we use protecting' (in the sense of learning) when we speak metaphorically of the Quran and other arts. The reason we do so is that when we learn something and memorize something, it does not leave us. Hence, we protect it. The Truth [al-Haqq], is an active participle, al-Muhiqq (in the right). He is attributed with it metaphorically because it is the infinitive. It is like their statement \"aid of those who call for help\" [ghiyath al-mustaghuthin]. The other meaning that is intended by it is that service of Allah is the truth, and service to other than Him is falsehood. The Word of the Mighty and High endorse this: That is because Allah is the Truth, and that what they call upon besides Him that is the falsehood, i.e. it becomes falsehood, leaves, and does not promise anyone reward or punishment. The Reckoner [al-Hasib], its meaning is that He accounts [al-Muhsi] for everything. He has knowledge of them and nothing is hidden from Him. The second meaning is that He is the One who Holds Account [al-Muhasib] for His Servants. He holds them accountable for their actions and rewards them for those actions. It is a nominal type of the active participle similar to jails and mujalis (sitting in someone's company). The third meaning is that: He is Sufficient for us. This thing is enough for me, i.e. sufficient for me. I reckoned him i.e. I bestowed upon him until he said: \"enough for me.\" This is seen in the Word of the Mighty and High: A reward for your Lord, a gift according to a reckoning, i.e. a sufficiency. The Praiseworthy [al-Hamid], the meaning of this is the Praised one [al-Mahmud]; it is the nominal type of passive participle. Praise is opposite of censure. It is said: I praised so and so when I was pleased with his action, and spread it among the people. The Most Gracious [al-Hafi], its meaning is the All-Knowing. As we see in the Word of the Mighty and High: They ask you as if you were solicitous about it, i.e. they ask you about the hour (Day of Judgment) as if you know the time of its coming. The other meaning is that He is the Subtle. Al-higayah is the infinitive; al-Hafi is the Subtle, the One that honors you for your goodness and kindness. The Lord [al-Rabb], its meaning is the Master. Whoever possesses a thing is its lord. As we see in the Word of the Mighty and High: Go back to your lord, i.e. to your Master and Sovereign. Someone in the Battle of Hunayn said: \"If",

He cannot be uttered by words, cannot be embodied in person, cannot be described by anthropomorphism, and cannot be colored by colors. Regions are negated from Him. Limits are far from Him. The sense of every imaginer is covered from Him. He is understood and not hidden. Hence, He has made it a complete word in four parts altogether. Neither one of them precedes the other. Then he showed three of those names to creation out of their need for them, and hid one of them. That is the well-kept treasured name through which these names were manifested. Thus, the apparent is Allah, the Blessed and Exalted. He, glory be to Him, utilized each one of the four first principles, and that became twelve principles. Then He created for each of the principles thirty names, in effect, related to them. They are the Most Compassionate, the most Merciful, the Sovereign, the Most Holy, the Creator, the Maker [al-Bari'], the Imager, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsistent [al-Qayyum], slumber seized Him not, nor does sleep, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware, the All-Hearing, the all-Seeing, the Most Wise, the Honorable, the Supreme, the Possessor of all Greatness [al-Mutakabbir], the Most High, the Most Great, the All-Powerful [al-Muqtadir], the Omnipotent, the Giver of Peace [al-Salam], the Granter of Security [al-Mumum], the Guardian over All [al-Muhaymin], the Maker, the Producer, the Originator [al-Badi'], the Lofty [al-Rafi]. The Sublime, Generous, the Sustainer, the Giver of Life, the Causer of Death, the Raiser [al-Baith], and the Inheritor. These are the names, among which are the Most Beautiful Names, until 360 names are complete. Thus, these are related to the three names. These three names are the first principles, and concealment for the Well-Kept treasured name by these three names. As we read in the Word of the Mighty and High: Say, call upon Allah or call upon the Most Compassionate Allah; whichever you call upon, He has the best names.",

However, He chose names for Himself so that He could be called upon, because unless He is called upon by His Name, there is no way for Him to be known.

Allah is the destination of all those who seek to reach Him. The aimer is other than the aimed. The aimed is described, and everything which is described is created. The Creator of All Things is not described with the limit of the named. He is not formed so that His Form could be compared to the created. Anything which is intended is other than Him. He is never disregarded by whoever understands this conclusion and that is pure Tawhid. Thus, listen to Allah, accept Him, and try to understand Him with His permission. Whoever claims that he has recognized Allah through concealing or revealing an image or the like, is a polytheist, because anything concealed or revealed is other than Him. Verily, He is One United Being. Therefore, how can one profess a belief in Divine Unity when one recognizes Him by other than Him? Only he has recognized Allah who recognizes Him by Allah (Himself). Thus, whoever does not recognize Him by Himself has not recognized Him, and certainly has recognized other than Him. There is nothing between the Creator and the created.

And as for your word: what is not from Allah, then oppression is not from Allah. The Jewish man said: I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.",

Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Ahmad ibn Yunus al-Laythi said: Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Said al-Hamdani freed slave of the Hashimites said: al-Harith ibn Abu Usamah reported to us in reading, on the authority of al-Mada'ini, on the authority of all three Uwanah ibn al-Hakm; Abd Allah ibn al-Abbas ibn Sahl al-Saidi and Abu Bakr al-Khurasani freed slave of the Hashimites, on the authority of al-Harith ibn Hasirah, on the authority of Abd al-Rahman ibn Jundab, on the authority of his father and others that The people came to al-Hasan ibn Ali (AS) after the death of Ali (AS) to pay allegiance to him. So he (AS) said: All praise is for Allah over what He destined in matter, specified in merit, generalized in affair and glorified in well-being, a praise with which He completes over us His bounties and we require His pleasure. Verily, this world is an abode of tribulation and mischief. Everything that is init has a decline. Allah has informed us of that so that we may take a lesson. Therefore He preceded with a threat to us so that there is no evidence for us after warning. So be ascetic in what is to perish and desirous in what is to remain. Fear Allah in privacy and in open. Verily, Ali (AS) in life, death and the rising lived with a measure and died with the time. Verily, I shall accept your allegiance on that you will make peace with whom I make peace with and fight with whom I fight with.Thus, they all paid allegiance to him on that basis. Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn, the Compiler of this book says: The ajal is the death of a human and the time of his death. And the ajal of his living is the time of his living. That is the meaning of the word of Allah, the Mighty and High: So when their (appointed) time comes they shall not delay it even an hour, nor shall they go before. If a human dies a natural death on his bed or is killed then verily the ajal of his death is the time of his death. It is possible that if a murdered person was not killed, he would have died in that instance anyway. It is also possible that if he was not killed then he would have lived on. The knowledge of that is unseen for us. Allah, the Mighty and High, has said; Say: Had you remained in your houses, those for whom slaughter was ordained would certainly have gone forth to the places where they would be slain. He has also said: Say: Flight shall not do you any good if you fly from death or slaughter. If a group of people are killed at the same time, it is possible to say that all of them died at their time and eve if they wee not killed they would have died in that instance. For, it is possible that a disease would have occurred in all of them and would have killed them all in that instance. It is not possible to say that they all died without the time of their death. As a whole, the ajal of a person is the time of his death that Allah, the Mighty and High, knows that he will die in that hour or will be killed. The word of al-Hasan (AS) concerning his father (AS) that \"he lived with a measure and died with the time? Is a confirmation of what we have said about this matter. Allah is the Granter of Direction to the correctness with His Favor.",

Perhaps you think predestination is irrevocable, and the decree is inseparable. If that were so, then the reward, the punishment, the commandment, the prohibition, and the reprimand would all be annulled. The meaning of threatening and promise would disintegrate. There would be no blame for the evil-doer, and no praise for the good-doer. In fact, the good-doer would be worthier of blame than the sinner, and the sinner would be worthier of praise than the good-doer. This is the claim of the idol worshippers, the opponents of the Most Compassionate, the free-willers of this Ummah, and its Zoroastrians. O Shaykh! Verily, Allah, the Mighty and High, has obliged with choice, forbidden with warning, granted plenty for little, does not consider the one who was coerced to be a sinner, does not require the subjected to obey, and has not created the heaves and the earth and that which is between them without a purpose. This is the assumption of the unbelievers. Woe to those who disbelieve in Hell.

May your Lord reward you with beneficence on your behalf! Hence, there is no excuse for committing indecency, Which I perpetrated with un-justice and disobedience, No, no, I do not claim that the forbidder has dropped him In it, because then I would be serving the Satan, O people, Nor does He like or will the un-justice; nor Killing the Guardian with oppression and enmity.

Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Yaqub alKulayni through his source of transmission, said\nWhen Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) had a word with Ibn Abu al-Awja', he returned to\nAbu\nAbd Allah (AS) the next day and sat down speechless. Therefore, Abu Abd Allah (AS) said: \"It seems as if you have returned to discuss some of the things we discussed\nbefore.\"\nHe replied, \"That is what I intend, O son of the Messenger of Allah!\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said: \"How astonishing is this? You reject Allah, but you bear\nwitness that I am the son of the Messenger of Allah.\"\nHe responded, \"It is a custom and a formality.\"\nThe Learned [al-alim] (AS) said to him, \"Then what prevents you from speaking?\"\nHe replied, \"My reverence for you. Even my tongue venerates you, preventing it from\nverbalizing anything. Verily, I have consulted with scholars and debated with\ntheologians, but never has such a sense of awe entered me as when I am in your\npresence.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"That may be the case. However, I will start with a question.\"\nHe approached him, and asked: \"Are you created or uncreated?\"\nAbd al-Karim ibn Abu al-Awja' answered, \"I am not created.\"\nSo the Learned (AS) asked him, \"If you are uncreated, then describe to me how you\nwould be, had you been created?\"\nAbd al-Karim was baffled and unable to answer for a long time, focusing his eyes on\nthe piece of wood that was before him. He was saying \"Long, wide, deep, short,\nmoving, motionless, all of these are descriptions of its creation.\"\nThe Learned (AS) said to him, \"If you do not know the description of its formation, then\ncreate yourself on the basis of yourself.\"\nAbd al-Karim replied to him, \"You have posed a question that nobody has ever posed\nto me before, and which nobody will ever ask me after you.\"\nAbd Abd Allah (AS) responded to him,\nYou admit that this question has never been asked of you in the past. However, how\ncan you know that this question will never be posed to you in the future? O Abd alKarim! You have negated yourself, because you claimed that all things are the same in\nthe beginning. How, then can you precede or delay things in time?\nHe (AS) then continued,\nO Abd al-Karim! I will further clarify matters for you. If you had a bag which contained\njewels, and someone asked you \"Is there a gold-coin [dinar] in the bag?\" you would\ndeny that there is a gold-coin in bag. If the questioner then asked you \"Describe for me\nthe gold-coin,\" when you did not know how to describe it, would it be right for you to\ndeny its existence simply because you cannot describe it?\"\nHe replied, \"No.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) then responded to him, \"The universe, however, is far greater,\nlonger, and wider than the bag. Likewise, it is possible that there is something in the\nuniverse that was created but which you cannot describe from the uncreated.\"\nAbd al-Karim withdrew, but some of his friends surrendered to reason and embraced\nIslam while other remained obstinate in their unbelief as he did.\nHe returned on the third day and said: May I redirect the question?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said to him, \"Ask whatever you may wish.\"\nSo he asked, \"What is the proof for the emergence of bodies?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) replied,\nVerily, in contemplating all things, big, and small, I found that they all increase or\ndecrease from their original state. If they were eternal, however, then they would\ndecline or increase from their original state. This is because anything which can decline\nor change can be located and can disappear. Anything that exists after nonexistence\nhas emerged. And anything that exists did not exist at one point. Eternity (sempiternity)\nand nonexistence cannot co-exist in the same thing.\nAbd al-Karim said: \"On the basis of your reasoning, nothing that changes can be\neternal, and must have emerged. So, if something always remains small, how can it be\nsaid to have emerged?\"\nThe Learned (AS) answered,\nVerily, we are talking about this universe. Were it to be taken away and replaced with\nanother one, nothing would be left of the first one. That is sufficient proof that it has\nbeen taken away and replaced by another one. However, I shall answer you on the\nbasis of your assumption.\nWe say: Even if something remains small, that small thing could join with another small\nthing, and thus become bigger. And since it is subject to such change, it cannot be\neternal. Consequently, anything that is subject to change has emerged. There is\nnothing beyond that for you, O Abd al-Karim.\"\nSo he withdrew, full of shame and disgrace.\nWhen the next year approached, the Imam (AS) met him in the Sacred Mosque in\nMecca. So some of his followers [shiah] said to him: \"Ibn Abu al-Awja' has become a\nMuslim.\"\nThe Learned (AS) replied, \"He is blinded from faith. He will not submit.\"\nWhen he saw the Learned, he said: \"My Master, my Guardian.\"\nThe Learned (AS) asked him, \"What brings you to this place?\"\nHe answered, \"It is a custom. It is the practice of the town. And we want to watch all\nthese crazy people shave their heads and throw pebbles at Satan.\"\nHence, the Learned (AS) said: \"You remain firm in your arrogance and misguidance, O\nAbd al-Karm.\"\nWhen he started to talk, the Learned (AS) said to him, \"There is no quarrel in the\npilgrimage.\" Then the Imam (AS) shook off his cloak from his hand and said: \"If things\nare as you say, and they most certainly are not, then we are both saved. However, if\nthings are the way we ay, and they most certainly are, then we are saved and you are\ndestroyed.\"\nAbd al-Karim drew closer to the ones that were with him, and said: \"My heart is filled\nwith rancour. Take me away from here.\" Therefore, they took him out, and he died, may\nAllah deprive him of mercy!\nThe Compiler of this book says: Among the proof that bodies emerged is that bodies\nare subject to increase and decrease. They are subject to growth and development\nwhich makes them into different forms and shapes. Evidently, we already know that we\nhave not formed our bodies, nor anyone from our species has formed them. It is not\nrational to believe that bodies, which are subject to change, growth, development, and\nmeasure, and which are not eternal, can come about without a Planner.\nIf it is possible for the universe and all it contains to be without a Producer or a Creator,\nthen it would also be possible for smaller things. If this were the case, then we should\nbe able to find texts without authors, buildings without builders, and paintings without\npainters. However, it is not possible to find a boat that was not expertly designed by a\nbuilder. If all of this is impossible, then so is the argument that something can exist\nwithout a Creator. Everything we have mentioned, and which we have not mentioned, is\nsubject to change: the skies, time, the sun and the moon, their rising and their setting,\nthe seasons, trees and their fruits; the denial of which is the most obstinate\nstubbornness. This is clear. All praise be to Allah!\nI have asked one of the learned monotheists regarding proof that bodies emerged. He\nsaid: The proof that bodies emerged is that their existence is not separate from His\nExistence. The bodies do not have individual existence. They exist along with others.\nWhenever a body exists along with others, it cannot be unique, and can only have been\ncreated. Therefore, the body is created as it cannot be separate from the Creator nor\nprecede it.\nAnd among the proofs that Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is not a body is that there is\nnot a body that does not have a body that resembles it, which is physically present or\nat least imaginable. Whatever has a similarity of any kind is created and has emerged.\nTherefore, since Allah, the Mighty and High, is Eternal, it proves that He is devoid of a\nbody. One more thing: if someone speaks of a \"body\" literally, it subject to increase\nsince it applies to something which can be measured in terms of length and width, and\nsomething which is composed of parts.\nIf someone says: Verily, Allah, the Mighty and High, possesses a body, this statement\ncould only be true if one proves that the aforementioned descriptions could apply to\nHim. If what we have mentioned before can apply to Him, then it could only mean two\nthings: one, that He is created, and that he emerged like all bodies; or two, that all\nbodies are eternal. However, if the word \"body\" does not convey this meaning, and is\nonly the name of a word, then it is a convention. Thus, it would be like someone calling\nAllah, the Mighty and High, a human, composed of flesh and blood, metaphorically, and\nnot literally. However, the Names of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, should only be\ndrawn from the names which He Himself has used, or which have been taught to us by\nthe Messenger of Allah (SA) or the Rightly Guided Imams (AS).",

    "Content": "7. Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qittan said: al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Sukkari said: Muhammad ibn\nZakariyya said, on the authority of Jafar ibn Muhammad ibn Uamrah, on the authority of his\nfather, on the authority of Jafar ibn Muhammad, on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn\nAli, on the authority of his father Ali ibn al-Husayn, on the authority of his father, al-Husayn\n(AS) that\nThe Commander of the Faithful (AS) said:\nVerily, the body has six states: health, illness, death, life, sleep and wakefulness. Similar is the\nspirit: its life is its knowledge, its death is its ignorance, its illness is its doubt, its health is its\ncertainty, it sleep is its negligence, and its wakefulness is its preservation (against evil).\nThe Compiler of this book says: And amongst the proofs of the bodies having emerged is that\nthe bodies are not free from co-existence or separation, or from being in motion or being still.\nCo-existence, separation, motion and stillness have all emerged. Therefore, we have learnt\nthat the body has emerged due to the emergence of what does not separate from it, not\nprecedes it.\nIf someone says: Why did you say: Co-existence and separation are two independent\nconnotations and likewise motion and stillness, so that you may claim that the body is not free\nfrom them?\nIt would be replied to him: The proof of that is we find the body co-existing after being\nseparated, while it is possible for it to remain separated. If it was not so that it had emerged,\nthen it would not be more worthy for it to co-exist than to remain separated on what it was,\nbecause it dos not emerge itself in this time, so it may have emerged itself on what has coexisted. Neither has it annulled it this time so that it may exist due to its annulment. It is not\npossible for what has co-existed to take its meaning due to annulment. Do you not see that if it\nwas so that it would not co-exist but due to annulment of a meaning or it would not separated\nbut due to annulment of a meaning, then it would necessitate for it to co-exist and separate\nwithin one state due to the annulment of both meanings? Also, if everything was free form\ncontaining the meaning of co-existence and separated, then it would necessitate for the\naccidents to e co-existent and separated, because they are free of these (four) meanings. Its\nannulment has been explained and the proof of its annulment is that it co-exists due to\nemergence of a meaning and separated due to emergence of a meaning. Similar is the case\nfor the motion and stillness and all other accidents.\nIf someone says: if you said: The co-existent becomes co-existent due to the being of the coexistence and becomes separated due to the separation. Thus, why have you rejected it\nbecoming co-existent or separated due to both of their existence in it? Similarly, you\nnecessitate this statement: The co-existent becomes co-existent due to the negation of\nseparation and the separated becomes separated due to the negation of co-existence.\nIt would be replied to him: Indeed the co-existence and separation are opposites. Opposites\ndo not appear in one existence at the same time. However, this ruling does not apply in the\nnegation, because the negation of two opposites cannot be rejected in an existence at the same\ntime unlike their subsistence. This is why we have said that if a body co-exists due to\nnegation of separation and is separated due to negation of co-existence; it would necessitate\nfor them to become co-existent and separated due to the negation of separation and is\nseparated due to the negation of co-existence; it would necessitate for them to become co-\nxistent and separated due to the negation of both of them. Is it not so that both black and\nwhite colors are negated from a red color, while both are opposites? However, it is not\npossible for both of them to be present and co-exist at one time. Thus, it is proved that\nnegation of opposites cannot be rejected in one state like the way their affirmation can be\nrejected. Also, the one saying this has proved the co-existence, separation, motion and\nstillness and has necessitated that body cannot be free from them, because if it was free from\nthem it would necessitate for it to co-exist, be separated, be in motion and be still. For if it was\nfree from them it will not be attributed with this ruling. If the matter is such, and the body is not\nfee from these changes then it necessitates it being emerged. What also indicates this is that\nthe human being is ordered on co-existence, separation, motion and stillness and it carries\nthem out, and is praised for it, thanked for it and condemned over it if it was evil. We now\nknow that it is not possible to command the body to do or not to do, nor to praise it for that\naction or denounce it. Therefore, it is necessary for who can be commanded to do or not to do\nand deserves praise or criticism for that action to be other than the one who cannot be\ncommanded to do or not to do and not deserve praise or criticism for it. The requirement of\nthis is the affirmation of the accidents.\nIf he said: Why do you accept: The body is not free form co-existence, separation, motion and\nstillness. And why do you reject that it has never been free of them? Thus, this does not\nindicate upon the emergence of a body.\nIt would be replied to him: If it has ever been possible for it to be free from co-existence,\nseparation, motion and stillness then it would be possible now and we should witness it.\nTherefore, when it is not possible to find bodies without co-existence or separation, then we\ncome to know that they have never been free of them in the past.\nIf he says: Why do you reject that if the bodies could not be free of these in the past then it is\nnot possible for the bodies to be free of them in present?\nIt would be said to him: Time and space do not have an effect in this matter. Is it not so that if\nsomeone says: I was free from this in the first year r for twenty years and it has become\npossible for me after this period? Or it is possible for me in Syria but not in Iraq or it is possible\nin Iraq but not in Hejaz; he would be perplexed and ignorant to the wise and whoever\nendorses him would also be ignorant. Therefore, we know that time and space do not affect in\nthis. If there is no rule and effect in this matter, then it is necessary that the rule of body\napplies to it in what has passed and in what will come in the future has the ruling of the\npresent. When it is not possible for the body to be free in present form co-existence or\nseparation, and motion or stillness, we lean that it can never be free from these ever. If it could\nbe free form these in the past, then it cannot be rejected that it can remain as that in the\npresent. So if someone informs us about an unknown town that bodies there were neither co-\nxistent nor separated, neither in motion nor still, then we would doubt in that and not believe\nthat to be true. The annulment of that proof is the annulment of this statement. Moreover,\nwhoever proves that bodies are neither co-existent nor separated, most definitely proves them\nto be neither close together to one another nor far apart from each other. This attribution\ncannot be rational, because there should be either partition and distance between two bodies,\nor there should not be any partition and distance between them; there is not third way. If there\nis partition and distance between them, they would be separated. However, if there is no\npartition and distance between them, it would be necessary fro them to be co-existent,\nbecause this is the limit of the co-existence and separation. If it is so then whoever proves that\nbodies are neither co-existent nor separated, is proving them with an attribute that is not\nrational. And whosoever goes out of the boundary of rationality is a void-doer.\nSo if he says: Why do you accept that: The accidents are emerged and reject that they are not\neternal and are always connected to bodies?\nI would be replied to him: Because we find the co-existent when separated, the co-existence is\nannulled from it and separation emerge to it. Similar is the separated when made t co-exist,\nthe separation is annulled from it and the co-existence emerges to it. The eternal is eternal\ndue to itself. It is not possible for it to emerge and be annulled. Therefore, it is proved that the\nco-existence and separation are both emerged and like is the case for all accidents. Is it not so\nthat they are annulled by their contraries then emerge after that. Whatever has the possibility\nof emergence and annulment cannot be but emerged. Further more, the eternal being which\ncontinues have no need in its essence to a creator, clarifying that it is worthier of being\nxistent than nonexistent, because if it is not so then he would too exist but through a creator.\nIf it is so then we know that the eternal cannot be annulled, if it is worthier of being existent\nthan nonexistent. And that whatever can be annulled, cannot be eternal.\nIf he says: Why do you say that whatever does not have precedence over the emerged, it is\nnecessary for it to be emerged?\nIt would be replied to him: Because the emerged is that which comes about after not being\nthere and the eternal is the existent that has always been there. The existent that ahs always\nbeen there is necessarily the preceding over the one that came about after not being there.\nWhatever has not proceeded is the emerged. Therefore, its share of the essence is the share\nof the emerged, because it does not have the precedence but of the emerged. If it is so then\nthe emerged does not have the share of the eternal in the essence and precedence. Rather it\nwould be of the emerged. In addition whatever shares in its cause or is equal in its essence\nand does not have precedence over it then it is necessary for it to be emerged.\nIf he says: Is it not so that he body is free form accidents and it is not necessary for it to be an\naccident then why do you reject that it is not free from changes and that it is not necessary for\nit to have emerged?\nIt would be replied to him: We have attributed the accident [arad] that it is not of the attributes\nof precedence and subsequence. It is indeed informing about genuses of the accidents. If the\nbody does not precede it then it is not necessary that it may become from their genus. This is\nwhy it is not necessary for the body to be an accident, even if it does not precede over\naccidents, if it does not share the accidents in what makes them accidents. We attributed the\neternal that it is informing about its precedence and its essence not having any prior to it. And\nwe attributed the emerged that it is informing about its being connected with a finish and an\nend, and a beginning and start. If it is so, then whatever has no bodies preceding over it, it is\nnecessary for it to remain to a finish and an end, because it is no possible for an existence that\nis not present from the beginning to have precedence over another existence that is present\nfrom the beginning. If this is true, then the emerged shares in what it has emerged and that is\nits existence to an end. This is why it necessitates to be emerged for its existence to a finish\nand an end. Similar is the answer to all what one may ask in this matter from this issue.\nIf someone says: if it is proven that the body has emerged then what is the proof that it has\nOne who has emerged it?\nIt would be said to him: Because we find changes in their entirety are connected to the\nemerged.\nIf he says: Why do you say that the emerged are connected to the emerged for what it is?\nIt would be replied: Because if they were not emerged, they would not be in need of a creator.\nIs it not so that they were non-emerged existents or were nonexistent, it would not be possible\nthat they may be connected to the emerged. If it is so then it is proven that they are connected\nto the emerged for what the emerged is. Therefore, it is necessary for every emerged being to\nhave their ruling that every emerged being requires a creator or one that emerges them.\nThese are proofs of the supporters of the Unity (of God), which are in accordance with the\nBook and the authentic traditions of the Prophet (SA) and the Imam (AS).",

    "Content": "Chapter Forty-Three: Hadith Dhilib The Tradition of Dhilib. - 2\ntraditions\n1. Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qittan and Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq\n(may Allah have mercy on them both) said: Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Zakariyya al-Qittan said: Muhammad ibn al-Abbas said: Muhammad ibn Abu al-Suri related to me that Ahmad ibn abd\nAllah ibn Yunus said, on the authority Sad al-Kinani, on the authority of al-Asbagh ibn\nNubatah that\nWhen Ali (AS) assumed the Caliphate, and the people were paying allegiance to him, he\nleft for the Mosque wearing the turban, the outer garment [burdah], the shoes, and\nthe sword of the Messenger of Allah (SA). He (AS) went up the pulpit. He saw down\nfirmly. He crossed his fingers. He placed his hands cross his stomach. And he (AS) said:\nO assembly of People! Ask me before you are deprived of me. This is the vessel of\nknowledge. This is (the effect of) the saliva of the Messenger of Allah (SA). This is what\nthe Messenger of Allah (SA) fed me like the feeding of a bird. Ask me, for verily, I have\nthe knowledge of the First Ones and the Last Ones.\nBy Allah, if a cushion were folded up for me, I could sit on it and judge the believers in\nthe Torah on the basis of the Torah until the Torah would profess: Ali has spoken the\ntruth, and has not lied. He has judged you according to what Allah revealed through\nme.' I could judge the believers in the Bible on the basis of the Bible until the Bible\nwould profess: Ali has spoken the truth, and has not lied. He has judged you\naccording to what Allah has revealed through me.' And I could judge the believers in the\nQur'an on the basis of the Qur'an until the Qur'an would profess: Ali has spoken the\ntruth, and has not lied. He has judged you according to what Allah ha revealed\nthrough me.' All of you read the Qur'an day and night. Does anyone of you know what\nis revealed in it? If it were not for a single verse in the Book of Allah, I would have\ninformed of everything that has happened in the past, everything which is happening in\nthe present, and everything which will happen in the future up to the Day of Judgment.\nThat verse is this: Allah makes to pass away and establishes what He pleases, and with\nHim is the basis of the Book. He (AS) then continued: Ask me before you are deprived\nof me. By Allah who split the grain seed and the made the persons, if you asked me\nabout each and every verse; whether it was revealed during the day or during the night,\nwhether it was revealed in Mecca or Medina, or revealed while traveling or not while\ntraveling, the abrogating verses or the abrogated ones, the decisive verses or the\nallied ones, and their interpretations and their context, I would inform you.\nA man called Dhilib, who was sharp of tongue, eloquent in speaking, and brave at\nheart, stood up and said: \"The son of Abu Talib has certainly climbed on a difficult\nladder. In questioning him I will surely humiliate him today for all of you.\" Then he\naddressed the Imam (AS) and said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, have you seen your\nLord?\" The Imam (AS) replied, \"Woe to you, O Dhilib! I do not serve a lord that I have\nnot seen.\" He said: \"How did you see him? Describe Him for us.\" Ali (AS) responded,\nWoe to you! The eyes do not see him through means of vision, but the hearts see Him\nthrough certainty of faith. Woe to you, O Dhilib! Verily, my Lord cannot be described in\nterms of proximity or movement. He is the Most Subtle of the Subtle and cannot be\ndescribed in terms of subtletly. He is the Greatest of the Great whose greatness cannot\nbe described in terms of greatness. He is the Grandest of the Grand whose grandeur\ncannot be expressed in terms of grandeur. He is the Highest of the High whose\nhighness cannot be described in terms of toughness. He is the Most Affectionate of the\nAffectionate whose mercy cannot be described in terms of delicateness. He is the\ngranter of Security, but not through sevice. He perceives not by touch, nor speaks\nthough enunciation. He is Present in all Things, but not physically. And he is Absent in\nAll thins, but not through conflict. He is Above all Things, yet it cannot be said that\nsomething is above Him. He is in Front of All Things, but it cannot be said: He as a\nfront. He Permeates all Things, but He is neither inside nor outside them.\nDhilib dropped fainting, and when he woke up again, he said: \"By Allah, I have never\nheard the likeness of this reply, and by Allah I shall never ask such questions again.\"\nThe Imam (AS) then continues: \"Ask me before you are deprived of me.\"\nSo al-Ashath ibn Qays stood before him and asked, \"O Commander of the Faithful! Why\nare the Zorastrians taxed [jizyah] when no book was revealed to them and no\nprophet was sent to them?\" The Imam (AS) replied, O Ashath! Allah certainly revealed\na Book for them, and sent them a Messenger. They once had a king, who got drunk one\nnight, called his daughter to his bed, and committed incest with her.\nWhen he got up in the morning, the people heard of this, gathered at his door and said:\n\"O king! You have defiled and disgraced our religion and destroyed it. Come out at\nonce so that we can purify you through the legal punishment [hadd].\"\nHe replied to them: \"Gather together, and listen to my speech. If there is a way out for\nme from what I have perpetrated, then so be it. Otherwise, do with me as you please.\"\nSo they gathered and he addressed them: \"Do you know that Allah has not created a\ncreation more honorable to Him than our father Adam and our mother Eve?\" They\nreplied: \"You are right, O king.\" He said: \"Is it not so that his sons married his\ndaughters and his daughters married his sons?\" They answered: \"You are right. This is\nthe religion.\" Based on that they contracted in marriage. Hence Allah took away the\nknowledge from their chests, and raised the Book from them. Thus, they are\nunbelievers. They shall enter the Hell without any accountability and the hypocrites are\nworse off than them. Ashath said: \"By Allah, I have never heard the likeness of this\nreply, and by Allah I shall never ask such questions again.\" The Imam (AS) then\ncontinued: \"Ask me before you are deprived of me.\" So a man from further away in the\nMosque stood up, leaning on his stake. He crossed all the people until he was close to\nthe Imam (AS). Then he said: \"O Commander of the Faithful! Teach me something that\nwill save me from the Fire.\" Ali (AS) said to him, Listen to me, O man, and understand!\nThis world is established on three things: on a leaned person who speaks using his\nknowledge; on a wealthy person who is not miserly with his wealth towards the\nreligious; and on a patient poor person. Thus, if the learned hides his knowledge, the\nwealthy acts miserly, and the poor do not practice patience, they shall meet the\naffliction and ruin. At that point the recognizers of Allah know that he house will return\nto its origin, i.e. disbelief after faith. O Questioner, do not be dazzled over large\nnumbers of mosques and groups of people who are united in their bodies, but\nseparated in hearts. O questioner! Verily, there are three types of people: the ascetic\n[zahid], the hedonist [raghib], and the patient person [sabir]. As for the ascetic, he is\nnever pleased with anything from this world that comes to him nor is he displeased\nover anything that expires from him. As for the patient person, he longs for the world\nfrom his heart, but when he finds anything from it he refrains from it due to knowing its\nevil result. As for the hedonistic, he is careless of obtaining the world from permissible\nmeans or forbidden means. This man asked, \"O Commander of the Faithful! What is the\nsign of a believer in such a time?\" He (AS) replied, \"He fulfils the obligations that Allah\nhas imposed upon him and he keeps away from what Allah has forbidden, regardless of\nhow much he yearns for it.\" The man asked, \"You are right, by Allah, O Commander of\nthe Faithful.\" Then the man disappeared, and we did not see him. So the people looked\nfor him, but did not find him. Ali (AS) smiled, while on the pulpit, and said: \"What is the\nmatter with you? That was my brother, al-Khidr (AS).\" The Imam (AS) then continues:\n\"Ask me before you are deprived of me.\" No one stood up to him. Hence, he praised\nAllah and extolled Him, and sent his blessings on the Prophet (SA). He then said to al-\nHasan (AS), \"O Hasan, stand up and go up the pulpit and deliver a speech so that the\nQuraysh may not claim ignorance of you after me, otherwise they will say: \"Verily, al-\nHasan ibn Ali knows nothing good.\" Al-Hasan (AS) said: \"O father! How can I go upon\nthe pulpit and speak when you are among the people listening and seeing?\"\nAli (ibn Abu Talib) said to him, \"May my father and mother be your ransom! I will\nconceal myself form you and will listen and see you while your cannot see me.\" Al-\nHasan (AS) went up the pulpit, praised Allah profusely, and blessed the Prophet (SA)\nbriefly. He (AS) then said: \"O people, I have heard my grandfather the Messenger of\nAllah (SA) say: \"I am the City of Knowledge and Ali is its Gate. A city can only be\nentered by its gate.\" Then he (AS) came down. Ali (AS) leapt towards him, pulled him,\nand embraced him. Then he said to al-Husayn (AS), \"O my son! Stand up. Go to the\npulpit and deliver s speech so that the Quraysh cannot claim ignorance of you after me;\notherwise, they will say: \"Verily, al-Husayn ibn Ali has no vision. Your speech should\nbe subsequent to your brother's speech.\"\nAl-Husayn (AS) went up the pulpit, praised Allah profusely, and blessed the Prophet\n(SA) briefly. He (AS) then said: \"O Assembly! I heard my grandfather, the Messenger of\nAllah (SA) says: \"Verily, Ali is the City of Guidance. Whoever enters it is saved, and\nwhoever fails to enter it is lost.\"\nAli (AS) leapt towards him, embraced him, and kissed him. Then he (AS) said: \"O\nAssembly! Bear witness that these two are sons of the Messenger of Allah (SA) which\nhe has entrusted to my custody, and I am entrusting them to you. Beware O people, as\nthe Messenger of Allah (SA) will question you about them.\"",

His name was Dhilib, who was sharp of tongue, eloquent in\nspeech, and brave at heart said: \"O Commander of the Faithful! Have you seen your\nLord?\"\nThe Imam (AS) replied, \"Woe to you! O Dhilib. I do not serve a Lord that I have not\nseen.\"\nHe said: \"O Commander of Faithful, how did you see him?\"\nAli (AS) responded,\nWoe to you! O Dhilib. Eyes cannot perceive him by means of vision, but hearts see Him\nthrough certainty of faith. Woe to you, O Dhilib! Verily, my Lord is the Most Subtle of\nthe Subtle, but whose subtetly cannot be described in terms of subtlety. He is the\nGreatest of the Great, whose greatness cannot be described in terms of greatness. He\nis the Grandest of the Grand, whose grandeur cannot be described in terms of\ngrandeur. He is the Highest of the High, who cannot be described in terms of\ntoughness. He preceded everything, so it cannot be said that something preceded Him.\nHe will remain forever, so it cannot be said that there shall be something after Him. He\nis the One that wills all things, but not through resolution. He is the MostAccomplishing, but not through deception. He is Present in all Things, but not\nphysically or through conflict. He is Manifest, but not in the sense of pursuit. He is\nEvident, but not by means of vision. He is Separate, but not by means of distance. He is\nClose, but not through attachment. He is Subtle, but not by means of a body. He is\nExistent not after nonexistence. He is the One who Accomplishes, but not by means of\ncompulsion. He is the Appraiser, but not by means of movement. He is the Intender, but\nnot through resolution.\nHe is the All-Hearing, but not by means of an auditory organ. He is All-Seeing, but not\nby a visual organ. Space does not encompass Him. Time does not escort Him.\nAttributes do not limit Him. Slumber seizes Him not. His Essence precedes time, and\nHis Being precedes nonexistence. His beginning its sempiternal.\nThrough His Formation of gatherings, it is known that He has no gathering. Through\nHis Creation of substances, it is known that He is not a substance. Through His\nCreation of opposites, it is known that He has no opposite. Through His Creation of\ncompanions, it is known that He has no consort. He made Light opposite of darkness, dry-\nness opposite of moisture, and cold opposite of heat. He is the Composer of these\nopposites and the Differentiator between their closeness. This composition is an\nindication over the Composer and the differentiation over the Differentiator. That is\nthe Word of the Mighty and High: And of everything We have created pairs that you may\nreflect.\nThus, He has differentiated through this between \"before\" and \"after\" so that it\nbecomes known that He has no before or after. Our instinct tells us instinctively that\nthe Giver of Instincts has no instinct. Our subjection to time tells us that the Creator of\nTime is not subjected to time. The veils that He has placed between some people tell us\nthat there is no veil between Him and His Creation. He was still a Lord when there was\nno one to rule over. He was still a Deity when there was no one to worship Him. And He\nwas still All-Knowing when there was nothing to be known. And He was still All-\nHearing, when there was nothing to be heard.\nThen Ali (AS) composed this poem:\nMy Master has always been recognized with praise,\nMy Master has always been attributed with generosity,\nYou existed even when there was no light to burn,\nAnd when no darkness clinged to the horizon,\nOur Lord differs from everything in creation,\nAnd from whatever the imagination can conceive,\nSo whoever attempts to describe Him in human terms,\nWill return besiege, tying his shoulder with incapability,\nIn the ways of ascent are seen the waves of His Omnipotence\nA wave that exhibits blindly, in blink of an eye, like a spirit,\nTherefore, leave the narrow-minded debater in religion,\nWho the doubt ha touched, making his vision absurd,\nAnd be in the company of the reliable one, for the love of His Master,\nWho is received with honor fro His Guardian,\nA proof of guidance entered in the evening spreading in the earth,\nAnd in heaven, He is recognized with the beautiful sate.\nThe reporter said: Dhilib dropped fainting, and when he woke up again, he said: \"I have\nnever heard this speech, and I shall never ask such questions again.\"\nThe Compiler of this book says: In this tradition are words which al-Rida (AS) has already\nmentioned in his sermon.

Then they were directed to\nthe Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS), so they asked him (those\nquestions), and he answered them. Among the queries he was asked:\n\"Inform me about the Lord. Where is He, and where was He?\"\nAli (AS) replied,\nThe Lord, Exalted be His Glory, is not subject to space. He is how He was, and He was\nas He is now. He is not in any place, nor has He declined from one place to another. He\nis not encompassed in one place; rather, He has always been without boundary and\nwithout quality.\nThe Catholicos said: \"You have spoken the truth. Now tell me about the Lord. Is He in\nthis world or is He is the Hereafter?\"\nAli (AS) replied,\nOur Lord existed before this world existed, and He will exist forever. He is the Planner\nof this World, and the All-Knowing of the Hereafter. It is not possible for Him to be\nencompassed by this world or the Hereafter. However, He knows all that is in this\nworld, and all that is in the Hereafter.\nHe said: \"You have spoken the truth. May Allah have mercy on you!\" He then asked,\n\"Tell me about our Lord. Does He carry or is He carried?\"\nAli (AS), thus, replied, \"Verily, our Lord, Exalted be His Glory, carries and is not\ncarried.\"\nThe Christian asked, \"How is that? In the Bible we find that The Empyrean of your Lord\nis carried about them on the day by eight angels.\"\nAli (AS) answered,\nVerily, the angels carry the Empyrean. However, the empyrean is not shaped like a bed\nas you image. Rather, it is something bounder, crated, and planned, which is subjected\nto the Lord. It is not as if He is on it like something being carried by another. He has\nordered angels to carry it, and they do so with the power that he has granted them.\nThe Christian said: \"You have spoke the truth, May Allah have mercy on you!.\"\nThe Compiler of this book says: The Tradition is long.

    "Content": "m 289 290 291 m  > Hisham ibn al-Hakam related the story of the Catholicos, primate of the Armenian church of the Christians, who was named Burayhah, and had been the Catholicos for seventy years. He used to research Islam, and sought to debate those Muslims who were familiar with the Christian gospels, and who were familiar with the Messiah, his attributes, arguments, and signs.\nHe says: He had been known for that until he became famous among the Christians, Muslims, Jews, and Zoroastrians. The Christians use to be so proud of him that they would say: \"If there was no one on earth in the Christian faith except Burayhah that would suffice us.\" He was seeker of the truth and with that, of Islam. He had a woman 292 \nwith him that used to serve him and she had been with him for a long time. He use to secretly tell her about the weakness of Christianity and its weak proofs.\nHe said: I came to know that from him.\nThus, Burayhah put this matter behind him, and approached the various Muslim schools who differed a bout Islam, in search of the most learned one among them. He came asking about the Muslim leaders, their pious one, their scholars, and their leading intellectuals.\nHe examined every Muslim school of though, and found nothing that satisfied him.\nHe said: \"If you leaders were on the true path, then they would have some truth with them!\" Finally, he learned about the Shiites from Hisham ibn al-Hakam.\nYunus ibn Abd al-Rahman says: Hisham said to me.\nI was sitting in my shop at the door of al-Karkh while a group of people were reciting the Qur'an to me. I was suddenly taken aback by a group of Christian clergymen. There were approximately one hundred men, dressed in the black clothing and chasubles (of the Coptic priests) and the Great Catholicos. Burayhah was among them.\nThey came down around my shop and placed a chair for Burayhah to sit on. The bishops and monks stood learning over their staffs, and on their heads were their chasubles. Burayhah addressed me and said: \"I have exhausted every single Muslim theologian in debate regarding Christianity, and they had nothing that impressed me. Hence, I have come to you wishing to debate Islam.\"\nHe says: Hisham laughed and said: \"O Burayhah! If you expect me to give you the same type of signs that he Messiah gave, you have come to the wrong place as I am not the Messiah, not even close. I would never critics him, though, as he was one of the purified ones, who was humble in character, yet sublime in spirituality. The Signs of Allah wee manifest in him.\"\nBurayhah responded, \"Your words astonish me.\"\nHisham said: \"If you want to argue then go ahead.\"\nBurayhah said: \"Yes. I certainly want to question you: What is the physical tie between your Prophet and the Messiah?'\"\nHisham replied, \"He is the son of his maternal grandfather, because Jesus is from the children of Ishaq, and Muhammad (SA) is from the children of Ismail.\"\nBurayhah asked,\nHow do you relate him to his father?\"\nHisham answered, \"If you want his lineage from your view, I will inform you of it, and if yo want his linage according to us, I will inform you of that.\"\nBurayhah enquired, \"I want his lineage according to us.\" Burayhah says that I was thinking that if he described his lineage according to us, I would overpower him. So I said: \"Describe his lineage the way we relate it.\"\nHisham explained, \"Yes. You say: \"He is without beginning from the one without beginning. Then who is the Father and who is the Son?\"\nBurayhah said: \"He who came unto the Earth is the Son.\"\nHisham asked, \"He who came unto the Earth is the Father.\"\nHe said: \"The Son is the messenger of the Father.\"\nHisham added, \"Verily, the Father is wiser than the Son, because the Father is the Creator.\"\nBurayhah said: \"Verily, the Father and the Son are both the Creators.\"\nHisham continued, \"What prevented them from coming down to Earth together like they were together when they created the world?\"\nBurayhah replied, \"How do they associate while they are both one thing? They differ only by name.\"\nHisham responded, \"Verily, they unite with the name.\"\nBurayhah said: \"This statement is unknown.\"\n293\nHisham said: \"This statement is well-known,\"\nBurayhah responded, \"Verily, the Son is connected to the Father.\"\nHisham replied, \"Verily, the Son is disconnected from the Father.\"\nHe replied, \"This is contrary to what the people would think.\"\nHisham explained, \"If what the people think is true, then I have overcome you for the Father was when the Son was not. Is that what you are saying, O Burayhah?\"\nHe answered, \"I do not say this.\"\nHisham responded, \"Then why did you seek to confirm your beliefs on the beliefs of those whom you reject?\"\nHe said: \"Verily, the Father is a name and the Son is a name, and the eternal has decreed them.\"\nHisham said: \"Are the two names without beginning? Are they eternal like the Father and the Son?\"\nBurayhah declared, \"No, The names are accidental (ones with beginning.)\"\nHe responded, \"You have certainly made the Father a Son, and the Son a Father. If the Son brought these names about, and not the Father, then he is the Father. And if the Father brought these names about, and not the Son, then he is the Father, and the Son is the Father. Thus, there is no Son here.\"\nBurayhah said: \"Verily, the Son is a name of the Holy Spirit when it came down to the Earth.\"\nHisham responded, \"What was its name prior to coming down to Earth?\"\nBurayhah continued on, baffled: \"Its name is the Son whether it came down or did not came down.\"\nHisham advocated, \"So before the coming down of this Spirit, it was all one but it had two names.\"\nHe said: \"It is all one; one Spirit.\"\nHisham acclaimed, \"You are pleased to make some of it the Son and some of it the Father.\"\nBurayhah replied, \"No, because the name of the Father and the name of the Son are one.\"\nHisham said: \"Therefore, the Son is the Father of the Father, and the Father is Father of the Son, and there is one Son.\"\nThe bishops said to Burayhah with one voice: \"Nothing like this has ever happened to you, stand up!\"\nThus, Burayhah was confused and wanted to leave, so Hisham attached and said:\nWhat prevents you from embracing Islam? Is there any rancour in your heart? Then say it, otherwise I will ask you a question about Christianity. I will give you the night to think about it. Then, when you wakeup, you will only be interested in me.\nThe bishops said: \"Do not ask him the question, for it may create doubts about your faith.\"\nBurayhah said: \"Say it, O father of al-Hakam.\"\nHisham went on, \"Tell me, does the Son know everything that the Father does?\"\nHe answered, \"Yes.\"\nHisham asked, \"Tell me, does the Father know everything that is with the Son?\"\nHe answered, \"Yes.\"\nHisham asked, \"Tell me, does the Son have power over everything that the Father has power over?\"\nHe answered, \"Yes.\"\nHisham asked, \"Tell me, does the Father have power over everything which the Son has power over?\"\nHe answered, \"Yes.\"\n294\nHisham responded, \"Then how can one of them be the Son of his partner, while they are both equal, and how does each one of them oppress his partner?\"\nBurayhah said; \"There is no oppression between them.\"\nHisham continued, \"The truth between them is that the Son is the Father of the Father, and the Father is the Son of the Son. Spend the night thinking about this, O Burayhah.\"\nThe Christians dispersed, and they were wishing that they had never seen Hisham and his friends.\nYunus ibn Abd al-Rahman says: Burayhah returned in grief and anxiety till he reached his home. The woman that served him asked him, \"Why is it that I see you grieved and anxious/\" Hence, he related to her the debate between Hisham and him. She asked,\n\"Woe unto you! Do you want to follow truth or falsehood?\"\nBurayhah replied, \"Truth, of course.\"\nShe said to him, \"Wherever you find truth, then turn to it. Be careful of obstinacy. For verily, obstinacy is doubt, doubt is calamity, and those with doubt are in Hell.\"\nThe reporter says: He agreed with her statement and decided to go to Hisham the next morning. The next morning he went to Hisham when none of his companions were with him. He enquired, \"O Hisham! Do you have someone whose views and words you turn to, and profess his obedience?\"\nHisham answered, \"Yes, O Burayhah.\"\n\"What is his description?\"\n\"Are you asking about his lineage or his religion?\" Hisham replied,\nHe said: \"Both of them, the description of his lineage and his religion.\"\nHisham responded,\nAs for his lineage, it is the best of the lineages: He is the leader of the Arabs, the best of the\nQuraysh, and the most distinguished of the Hashimites. Whoever argued about his\nlineage always found it to be better than his own, because the Quraysh are the best of\nthe Arabs, and the Hashimites are the best of the Quraysh. And, as he is the best of the\nHashimites, he is the most pious among them, and their master. He descends from the\nchildren of the master, who are better than all other children. He is the son of the\nmaster.\"\nHe said: \"Describe his religion.\"\nHisham said: \"His law or description of body and his purity?\"\nHe said: \"Describe his body and his purity/\"\nHisham described,\nHe is infallible; thus, he does not sin. He is generous; hence, he does not act miserly.\nHe is brave; so he does not act cowardly. He has been bestowed with knowledge;\ntherefore, he does not act ignorantly. He is the Protector of the Religion, firm in what is\nmade mandatory. He is from the Progeny of the Prophets (AS), and the Vessel of\nProphetic Knowledge (AS). He pardons when he is angry. He is fair in times of\noppression. He helps when pleased, and is just towards both friend and foe. He does not\nask of deviation for his enemy and foes not prohibit benefiting his friends. He practices\nthe Book and speaks wonders. He is one of the Purified Ones. He relates the words of\nthe Divinely Elected Leaders without violating their Proof. He is not ignorant of any\nquestion. He can derive a ruling [fatwa] from any tradition, and makes clear all\ndarkness.\nBurayhah responded, \"You have described the Messiah in his attributes, and proved\nhim by his proofs and signs, except that you have applied this description to another\nperson. If there is a person who fits this description, we will believe in him.\"\nHisham said: \"If you believe you will be guided, and if you follow the truth you will not\nbe blamed.\" He then added, \"O Burayhah! There is not a proof which Allah establishes\nover the first of His Creation, except that He establishes it over the middle creation and\n295\nthe last creation. Therefore, Proofs do not become invalidated, just like nations and\npractices do not disappear.\"\nBurayhah admitted, \"How close is this to righteousness, and how near it is to the truth.\nThis is the attribute of the wise. They establish proof that negates suspicion.\"\nHisham said: \"Yes.\"\nThen they both departed together until they arrived at Medina. The woman was with\nthem. They both wanted to see Abu Abd Allah (AS). However, they met Musa ibn Jafar\n(AS), so Hisham related to him the account. When he finished, Musa ibn Jafar (AS)\nsaid: \"O Burayhah! How is your knowledge of your Book (the bible)?\"\nHe answered, \"I am knowledgeable of it.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked, \"How is your faith in its interpretation?\"\nHe replied. \"I am confident that I am knowledgeable about it.\"\nThe reported says: Musa ibn Jafar (AS) began reading the Bible. Burayhah responded,\n\"The Messiah must have read like this, and no one has read this recitation but the\nMessiah.\"\nBurayhah then said: \"I have been seeking you or someone like you for the past fifty\nyears.\"\nThe reporter says: Therefore, he embraced Islam and so did the woman, and both were\nexpediently faithful. The Hisham, Burayhah, and the woman entered the presence of\nAbu Abd Allah (AS). Hisham related the account and the discussion that took place\nbetween Musa (AS) and Burayhah.\nThus Abu Abd Allah (AS) read: Offspring one of the other; and Allah is Hearing,\nKnowing.\nSo Burayhah asked, \"May I be your ransom! How do you view the Torah, the Bible and\nthe Books of the Prophets?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) replied: \"We are their Heirs. We read them the way they were\noriginally read, and we convey them as they were originally conveyed. Verily, Allah\ndoes not place a Proof [hujjat] on His earth who, when questioned about something,\nanswers: I do not know.'\"\nHence, Burayhah remained with Abu Abd Allah (AS) until Abu Abd Allah passed away.\nThen he remained with Musa ibn Jafar (AS) until Burayhah died in his time. The Imam\n(AS) washed his corpse with his own hands, shrouded his body, and placed him in the\ngrave and said: \"This is a disciple from the disciples of the Messiah, who recognized\nthe right of Allah over him.\"\nThe reported says: Thus, most of the Companions of the Imam (AS) wished they were\nlike him.\n296\nChapter Thirty-Eight: Dhikr Azamat Allah, jalla Jalalahu. The\nRemembrance of Allah's Greatness, Mighty be His Glory - 11\ntraditions\n1. My father (may Allah have mercy on them) said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said: Ibrahim ibn\nHashim and others said, on the authority of Khalaf ibn Hammad, on the authority of al-Husayn\nibn Zayd al-Hashimi, that\n2\nk\nk\nk k\n297\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said:\nZaynab, the squint-eyed perfume lady, came to the wives of the Messenger of Allah\n(SA) and his daughters. The Messenger of Allah (SA) entered when she was with them.\nSo he (SA) said to her, \"When you visit us our houses are filled with perfume.\"\nHence, she replied, \"Your house is the most pleasant due to your own scent, O\nMessenger of Allah.\"\nHe (SA) said: \"When you sell, then be good. However, do not engage in deceptive\nmarketing for that is not a good practice for ensuring wealth.\"\nShe responded, \"I did no come with something to sell. Verily, I came to ask you about\nht Greatness of Allah.\"\nThus, he (SA) said: \"Glory be to Allah! Let me share His Greatness with you.\"\nThe reporter says: then he (SA) continued,\nVerily, the planet earth and everything it contains is like a ring in the vastness of the desert to the one which is below it. The earth and the one below it, and everything they\ncontain, are like a ring in the vastness of the desert to the one that is below them. This\nhow they are until it reaches the seventh one.\nThen he recited this verse: Allah is He who created seven heavens, and the Earth the\nlike of them.\nThe seven heavens and what they contain are on the back of a rooster like a ring in the\nopen desert. The rooster has two wings; one in the East and the other in the West, and\nits feet are on the borderline. The seven heavens, the rooster, and whatever they\ncontain, are on a rock like a ring in the open desert. The seven heavens, the rooster, the\nrock and whatever is in them, are on the back of a fish like a ring in the open desert.\nThe seven heavens, the rooster, the rock, and the fish are in a dark ocean like a ring in the\nopen desert. The seven heavens, the rooster, the rock, the fish, and the dark ocean are\nin the air like a ring in the open desert. The seven heave ns, the rooster, the rock, the\nfish, the dark ocean, the air, and the ground, and whatever is in them are beneath the\nground like a ring in the open desert.\nThen he (SA) recited this verse: His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth,\nand what is between them two, and what is beneath the ground.\nThen the tradition stopped.\n298\nThe seven heavens, the rooster, the rock, the fish, the dark ocean, the air, the ground, and whatever is in them are in heaven like a ring in the open desert.\nAll of these things, the heaven of this world, and whatever is in them, are like a ring in the\nopen desert. All of these things and the two heavens are like a ring in the open desert\ncompared to the third heaven. The third heaven and whatever is in it is like a ring in the\nopen desert compared to the fourth heaven, and so on until the seventh heaven.\nThese seven heavens and whatever is in them are like a ring in the open desert\ncompared to the ocean which covers the earth. The seven heavens, and the ocean\nwhich covers the earth, are like a ring in the open desert compared to the mountain.\nThen he (AS) read this verse: And He sends down from heavens (clouds like)\nmountains laden with hail.\nThese seven heavens, the covered ocean and the mountain are like a ring in the open\ndesert compared to the veils of light. There are seventy thousand of these blinding veils\nlight. The seven heavens, the covered oceans, the mountains, and the veils are like a\nring in the open-spaced desert in comparison to the air, in which the hearts are fervent.\nThen he (AS) read this verse His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and\nthe preservation of them both tires Him not, and He is the Most High, the Great.\nThe seven heavens, the covered oceans, the mountains, the veils, the air, and the\nThrone are like a ring in the open desert compared to the Empyrean.\nThen he (AS) read this verse: The Most Compassionate Allah is Firm on the Empyrean.\nThe angels cannot carry it except with the statement \"there is no god but Allah\" and\n\"there is no power and no strength save in Allah.\"\n2. My father (RA) said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said: Muhammad ibn Isa said, on the authority of\nal-Hasan ibn Mahbub, on the authority of Amr ibn Shimr, on the authority of Jabir ibn Yazid\nthat\nI asked Abu Jafar al-Baqir (AS) about the Word of the Mighty and High: He (AS) said: O Jabir! After Allah, the Mighty and High, destroys this creation, placing the people of\nParadise in Paradise, and the people of Hell in Hell, He will recreate another world\ndifferent from this one without men or women, to serve Him and profess His Unity. He\nwill create for them an earth different form this one. And He will create for them a\nfirmament different from the earth to give them shade. Perhaps you think that Allah\nonly created this world, and that Allah has not created other beings than you. No,\ncertainly not. Allah has created millions of worlds, and millions of human creations.\nAnd you re the last of those worlds, and the last of those beings.\n3. Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qittan said: Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Zakariyya said: Bakr ibn Abd\nAllah ibn Hubayb said, on the authority of Tamim ibn Buhlul, on the authority of Nasr ibn\nMuzahim al-Minqari, on the authority of Amr ibn Sad, on the authority of Abu Mikhnaf Lut ibn\nYahya, on the authority of Abu Mansur, on the authority of Zayd ibn Wahab that\n2\n300\nThe Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abu Talib was asked about the Omnipotence of\nAllah, Exalted and Glorified be He. Therefore, he (AS) stood up, delivered a sermon\npraising and exalting Allah. He then said:\nVerily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has created angels that are so enormous that\nthey cannot fly down to the earth due to the sheer size of their numerous wings. Among\nthem is an angel that is so huge that even if jinn and humankind worked together to\ndescribe him, they would be unable to do so due to the distance between its joints and\nthe beauty of its composed image.\nHow can one be described which has seven hundred years of distance between its\nshoulders and its earlobes? Among them is one who obstructs the horizon with one of\nits many wings without the complete enormity of its body. Among them is one who is\nso tall that the heavens merely reach his waist. And among them is one whose feet float\nin the atmosphere and its knees reach the earth. There is also an angel who is so huge\nthat all of the water on earth would fit in the cavity of his thumb. There is also one who\nis so hug that if ships were cast into the tears of its eyes, they could sail for the rest of\neternity. Blessed is Allah, the Best of the Creators.\nHe (AS) was questioned about the veils, so he answered,\nThe first of the veils are seven in number. The thickness of each veil is five hundred\nyears of travel. And the distance between the two veils is the distance traveled in five\nhundred years. The third veil is composed of seventy veils. Between each veil is the\ndistance traveled in five hundred years. The length of each veil is five hundred years of\ntravel.\nThere are seventy thousand angels acting as the gatekeepers for every veil. The\nstrength of each one of these angels is equal to the strength of all the jinn and men.\nThey are the source of darkness, light, fire, smoke, clouds, lightning, rain, thunder,\nglow, sand, mountain, dust, water and all rivers. There are different veils. The thickness\nof each one of these veils is the distance traveled over the course of seventy thousand\nyears.\nThen there are the Canopies of Glory [jalal], and there are seventy such canopies. In\neach canopy there are seventy angels. Between each canopy is the distance traveled\nduring five hundred years.\nThen there is the Canopy of Mighty [izz]; then the Canopy of Pride [kibriya]; then the\ncanopy of Greatness [azamah]; then the Canopy of Sacredness [qudus]; then the\nCanopy of Power [jabarut]; and then the Canopy of Pride [fakhr]. Then is the white light,\nthen the Canopy of Oneness [wahdaniyah], which spans the distance traveled over\nseventy thousand years into seventy thousand years; and then there is the Most\nSublime Veil.\nHence, his (AS) speech ended and he became silent.\nTherefore, Umar said to him (AS), \"I do not want to remain for a day when I do not see\nyou, O Father of al-Hasan.\"\n4. Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Abd Allah ibn Ahmad al-Aswari said: Makki ibn Ahmad ibn Sadwayh\nal-BurdhaI said: Uday ibn Ahmad ibn abd al-Baqi Abu Umayr reported to us in Adhanah\nthat Abu al-Hasan Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Bura' said: Abd al-Munim ibn Idris said: My\nfather related to me, on the authority of Wahab, on the authority of Ibn Abbas that\n301\n2 .\nThe Prophet (SA) said: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has create a rooster\nwhose feet are on the borderline of the lowly seventh earth, while its head is in the\nEmpyrean, and its neck is twisted below the Empyrean. It is an angel among the angels\nof Allah, the Mighty and High. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has placed its feet at the\nlowest level of the seventh earth. It crosses the earths, to the end of the earths, until it\ncomes out at the horizon of heaven. Then it passes the horizon until its first visible part\nreaches the Empyrean, while it says: \"Glory be to You, my Lord.\"\nVerily, this rooster has two wings. If it would spread them out, they would cross both\nthe East and the West. When it is the end of the night, it spreads its two wings, shakes\nthem, and it calls out with the glorification that \"Glory be to Allah, the Sovereign, the\nMost Holy. Glory be to the Great, the Supreme Being [al-mutal], the Most Holy. There is\nno god but He, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsistent.\"\nWhen it says so then all the roosters of the earth glorify, spread their wings, and begin\nto crow. And when that rooster becomes still then the rooster on the earth become still.\nAt the time of dawn, it spreads its two wings, which cross the East and the West, and\nshakes them, and calls out with the glorification: \"Glory be to Allah, the Great. Glory\nbe to Allah, the Honorable, the Subduer. Glory be to Allah, the Possessor of the\nGlorious Empyrean. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the Lofty Empyrean.\"\nWhen it does that then all the roosters of the earth do their glorification. Therefore, it\nwakes the rooster of the earth, who awake and answer its glorification of Allah, the\nMighty and High. The rooster ahs the purest white feathers I have ever seen. Below its\nwhite feathers it has the darkest green fuzz that I have ever seen. I am still longing to\nlook at the feathers of that rooster.\n5. With the same chain of transmission that\n302\nThe Prophet (SA) said:\nVerily, among the angels of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is an angel whose upper\nhalf is composed of fire, while its lower half is composed of ice. Neither does the fire\n303\n304\nmeltdoes the ice extinguish the fire. He stands calling with his high-pitched voice:\n\"Glory be to Allah, who withholds the heat of this fire so that it does not melt this ice;\nand Glory be to Allah who withholds the coldness of this ice so that it does not\nextinguish this fire. O Allah! O Combiner of the Ice and fire! Unite the hearts of Your\nBelieving Servants in Your Obedience.\"\n6. With the same chain of transmission that\nThe Prophet (SA) said:\nVerily, among the angels of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, are angels who glorify\nAllah, the Mighty and High, with the entirety of their beings, praising Him in every\ndirection with different voices. They do not lift their heads to heaven, nor do they lower\nthem to their feet from crying and fear of Allah, the Mighty and High.\n7. Muhammad ibn Musa al-Mutawakkil (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Kufi said,\non the authority of Musa ibn Imran al-NakahI, on the authority of his paternal uncle alHusayn ibn Yazid, on the authority of Ismail ibn Muslim that Abu Rahman ibn Abu Dharr,\non the authority of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (may the mercy of Allah be upon him) that\nI was holding the hand of the Prophet (SA) and we were both walking. We were looking\nat the sun and until it set, So I asked, \"O Messenger of Allah! Where does it set?\"\n[(Editor's footnote: This traditionis strange (gharib). As they do not agree with scientific\nfact, the words that follow cannot be attributed to the Prophet (SA)]\nHe (SA) replied,\nThe sun sets in the sky then it rises from the sky to another sky, until it rises to the\nseventh highest sky, which is below the Empyrean. Then, the sun prostrates, and the\nangels which are entrusted with it prostrate themselves along with it. At this point, the\nsun says: \"O my Lord! Do you command me to rise from the West or from my place of\nrising (the East)?\" According to the Word of the Exalted: Abd the sun runs onto a term\nappointed for it; that is the ordinance of the Mighty, the Knowing. What He means is\nthat He, the Mighty Lord, knows the Realm He has created.\nHe said: Then Jibrail comes to the sun with a dress which glows with the Light of the\nEmpyrean and fixes the times of day, making them lengthy during the summer, short\nduring the winter, and intermediate length during the call and spring. He said: Thus, the\nsun wears that dress like anyone of you wear your dress, then it brightens up with it the\nhorizon of the heaven until it rises from the place of rising.\nThe Prophet (SA) said: It is as if I am looking at it, and it is confined for three nights, then it\ndresses with the glow, and is commanded to rise from the West. That is the Word of the\nMighty and High: When the sun is covered, and when the starts darken. \nThe moon is similar in its place of rising, and its trajectory in the horizon of heaven. Its\nsetting is it is rising to the seventh heaven. It prostrates below the Empyrean then\nJibra'il comes to it with a dress of light from the Throne. According to the Word of the\nMighty and High He made the sun a shinng brightness and the moon a light.\nAbu Dharr (RA) says: \"I then withdrew with the Messenger of Allah (SA) and we prayed\nthe Maghrib prayers.\n304\n8. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar (RA) said: My father said: al-Husayn ibn alHasan ibn Aban related to us, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Auramah, o the authority of\nZiyad ibn al-Qandi, on the authority of Durust, on the authority of a man that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said:\n\"Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has created an angel who is so huge that it\nwould take a fluttering bird five hundred years to fly from its earlobe to its neck.\"\n9. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: Ahmad ibn Idris said, on the\nauthority of Muhammad ibn Ahmad, on the authority of al-Sayyari, on the authority of Abd\nAllah ibn Hammad, on the authority of Jamil ibn Durraj that\nI asked Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS). \"Are there oceans in heaven?\"\nHe replied,\nYes. My father related to me, on the authority of his father, and he on the authority of\nhis grandfather (AS) that the Messenger of Allah (SA) said:\nVerily, in the seven heavens there are oceans, the depths of which are like the distance\ntraveled over the course of five hundred years. In them are angels who have been\nstanding in service since they were created by Allah, the Mighty and High. The water\nbarely reaches their knees. There is not an angel among them but that he has fourteen\nhundred wings. On each wing, there are four faces. On each face there are four\ntongues. And there is no a single wing or a single tongue or a single mouth but this it\nglorifies Allah, the Mighty and High, with a glorification that does not resemble in any\nway the prayers of the others.\n10. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Walid (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar\nsaid, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn al-Hasan ibn Aban, on the authority of Muhammad ibn\nAuramah, on the authority of Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Maythami, on the authority of Abu alHasan al-Sharif, on the authority of Sad ibn Tarif; on the authority of Asbagh ibn Nubatah\nthat\nIbn al-Kawwa' came to the Commander of the Faithful (AS) and said: \"O Commander of\nthe Faithful! By Allah, verily there is a verse in the Book of Allah, the Mighty and High,\nthat has destroyed my heart, making me doubt my religion.\"\nAli (AS) said to him, \"May your mother be bereaved of you and be deprived of you!\nWhat is that verse?\"\nHe replied, \"The Word of Allah, the Exalted: The birds with expanded wings, each\nknows its own prayer, and its own glorification.\"\nImam Ali (AS) responded,\nO son of al-Kawwa'! Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has created angels in\ndifferent shapes. There is an angel of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, in the shape of a\nrooster, which is hoarse and gray. Its talons are in the seventh lowly earth and its dual\ncomb is below the Empyrean. It has two wings; one in the East and the other in the\nWest. One is of fire and the other is of ice.\nWhen the time of prayer comes, it stands on its talons and raises its neck from below\nthe Empyrean, and then it flaps its two wings like the roosters in your houses do.\nNeither the one that is from fire melts the ice, nor does the one form the ice put out the\nfire. At that point it calls:\nI bear witness that there is no got but Allah, He Alone, there is no associate with Him; and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Master of the Prophets and his successor is\nthe Master of the Successors and that Allah is the Most Praised, the Most Holy, Lord of\nthe Angels and the Spirit (Ruh).\nHe said: Then the roosters in your homes flap their wings and answer him in his call,\nand that is the Word of the Exalted: The birds with expanded wings, each knows its\nown prayer and its own glorification\" from the roosters in the earth.\n306\n11. My father (may Allah have mercy on them) said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said, on the authority\nof Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Ali, on the authority of\nYunus ibn Yaqub, on the authority of Amr ibn Marwan that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said:\n\"Verily, half of the angels of Allah, the Blessed and the Exalted, are in cold and half are\nin fire. They say: O Combiner of the Hot and Cold, keep our hearts firm in Your\nObedience.'\"\nThe Compiler of this book says: Allah willing, I will publish the traditions which I have\ntransmitted regarding remembering the Greatness of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, in\nthe book al-Azamat.'\n307\nChapter Thirty-Nine: Mana Lutf Allah Tabaraka wa-Taala.

Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: Muhammad ibn al-Hasan alSaffar on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa on the authority of his father on the\nauthority of Said ibn Janah on the authority of some of our scholars that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said:\nAmong the smallest things crated by Allah is the mosquito [baud], and the gnat [jirjis],\nwhich is smaller than the mosquito. And that what you name [al-walgh], which is even\nsmaller than a gnat. What is in an elephant is found in a mosquito; except for the\nmosquito has been given preference over the elephant by two wings.\n308\nChapter Forty: Adna Ma Yujzi min Marifat al-Tawhid. The Least\nRequired for Recognizing Diving Unity - 5 traditions\n1. Muhammad ibn Ali Majilwayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn\nHashim said, on the authority of Mukhtar ibn Muhammad ibn Mukhtar al-Hamdani, on the\nauthority of al-Fath ibn Yazid al-Jurjani that\nI asked Abu al-Hasan al-Kazim (AS) about the least that is required to recognize Divine\nUnity. Thus, he (SA) replied, \"the confirmation that there is no god other than Him. He\nhas no peer or rival. He is Eternal without beginning. He is the Firm, the Existent, and is\nnever Absent. There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him.\"\n2. Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said, on the authority of\nAhmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Said, on the authority of alNadr ibn Suwayd, on the authority of Asim Humayd that\nAli ibn al-Husayn (AS) was asked about Divine Unity; hence, he said Verily, Allah, the\nMighty and High, knew that there would be people in the Last Days who would think\ndeeply; therefore, Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed: Say: He Allah is One. Allah is\nthe Needless and the first few verses from the Chapter \"the Iron\" until He says: And He\nis Cognizant of what is in the hearts. Thus whosoever goes beyond that is ruined.\n3. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Abu Abd\nAllah al-Kufi said: Muhammad ibn Isamil al-Barmaki said: al-Husayn ibn al-Hasan related to\nme that Bakr ibn Ziyad related tome, on the authority of Abd al-Aziz ibn al-Muhtda that\nm  m    \nI asked al-Rida (AS) about Diving Unity; hence, he replied, \"All those who read: Say: He\nAllah is One, and believe in it, have professed their faith in Divine Unity.\"\nI asked, \"How should one read it?\"\nHe (AS) responded, \"The same way that the people read it, adding such is my Lord' \nthree times.\"\n4. My father and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) both said: Muhammad\nibn Yahya al-Attar, and Ahmad ibn Idris both said, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ahmad,\n,on the authority of some our scholars, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ali al-Tahi, on the\nauthority of Tahir ibn Hatim ibn Mahawayh that\nI wrote to al-Tayyib i.e. Abu al-Hasan Musa (AS): \"What is the least required to\nrecognize the Creator? Thus he (AS) wrote back: \"there is nothing whatsoever like unto\nHim. He has always been All-Hearing, All-Knowing, All-Seeing, and He is the Mighty\nDoer of whatever He wills.\"\n5. Muhammad ibn Ali Majilwayh (RA) related to me, on the authority of his paternal uncle\nMuhammad ibn Abu al-Qasim, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Yali al-Kufi, on the\nauthority of Juwaybir, on the authority of al-Dahhak, on the authority of Ibn Abbas that\nA Bedouin Arab came to the Prophet (SA) and said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Teach me\nthe wonders of knowledge.\" The Prophet (SA) asked, \"Before you ask about the\nwonders of knowledge, do you know about the beginning of knowledge?\"\nThe man enquired, \"What is the beginning of knowledge, O Messenger of Allah?\"\nHence, he (SA) replied, \"Recognizing Allah the way He deserves to be recognized.\"\nThe Bedouin further asked, \"And how does Allah deserve to be recognized?\"\nHe answered,\nYou have recognized Allah as He deserves to be recognized when you recognize that\nnothing resembles Him, that He has no compeer, and without any equal, that He is One,\nAlone, Manifest, the First and the Last, without parallel and without a rival. This is how\nHe deserves to be recognized.\n310\nChapter Forty -One: Innahu, azza wa jalla, la Yurafu illa Bihi. He,\nthe Mighty and High, in not Recognized, Except by Himself. - 10\ntraditions\n1. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMuhammad ibn Yaqub al-Kulayni said: Muhammad ibn Ismail said, on the authority of alFadl ibn Shadhan, on the authority of Safwan ibn Yahya, on the authority of Mansur ibn Hazim\nthat\nI said to Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS): \"Verily, I debated with a group of people and\nsaid to them, Verily, Allah is far above being recognized through His Creation. In fact,\nthe servants are those who are recognized through Allah.\"\nHe replied, \"May Allah have mercy on you!\"\n2. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: Muhammad ibn al-Hasan alSaffar said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid, on the authority of some of\nour scholars, on the authority of Ali ibn Uqbah ibn Qays ibn Saman ibn Abu Rabihah, the\nfreed slave of the Messenger of Allah (SA), who hurried the transmission that\nm\nThe Commander of the Faithful was questioned, \"With what do you recognize your\nLord?\" He (AS) answered, \"With what He introduced Himself.\" It was said: \"How did He\nintroduce Himself to you?\" He (AS) replied, No image resembles Him. He is neither\nperceived by the senses, nor compared with the people. He is Near in His Farness, and\nFar in His Nearness. He is Above all Things. It cannot be said that \"something is above\nHim,\" as He is in front of everything. It cannot be said that \"He has a front,\" since He is\nInside Everything, but without being contained. He is Outside of Everything, but without\n312\nbeing absent from anything. Glory be Him! There is nothing like unto Him. He is the\nOriginator of All Things.\n3. My father (RA) related to me that Sad ibn Abd Allah said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn\nMuhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Abu Umayr, on the authority of\nMuhammad ibn Humran, on the authority of al-Fadl ibn al-Sakan, on the authority of Abu Abd\nAllah AS) that\nThe Commander of the Faithful said: \"Recognize Allah through Allah, the Messenger\nthrough the message, and the ones vested with authority [ulu al-amr] through their\nbeneficence, justice, and good deeds.\"\n4. Abu al-Husayn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Ishaq al-Farisi said: Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn\nAbu Said al-Nisawi said: Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah al-Sughdi said in\nMarw that Muhammad ibn Yaqub ibn al-Hakam al-Askari and his brother Muadh ibn Yaqub\nboth said: Muhammad ibn Sinan al-Hanzali said: Abd Allah ibn Asim said: Abd al-Rahman\nibn Qays said, on the authority of Abu Hashim al-Rummani, on the authority of Zadhan that\nSalman the Persian related the following detailed tradition concerning the coming of\nthe Catholicos to Median with one hundred Christians and asking Abu Bakr questions.\nHe could not answer so he guided them to the Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abu\nTalib (AS). Therefore, he asked Ali (AS) some questions; thus, he answered them all.\nAmong the questions the Catholicos asked him was: \"Tell me. Did you recognize Allah\nthrough Muhammad or di you recognize Muhammad through Allah, the Mighty and\nHigh?\" Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) replied, I did not recognize Allah through Muhammad\n(SA), but I recognized Muhammad through Allah, the Mighty and High, when He created\nhim and made in him the size of the length and breadth. Hence I recognized that He was\nthe Planner of the Produced through reasoning, and inspiration, the same way He\ninspired His Angels to recognize and obey Him without any compeer and quality.\nThe Compiler of this book says: The tradition is long. We have extracted from it the required\npassage. I have transmitted all of it in the end of the book Al-Nubuwwah.\n5. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said:\nMuhammad ibn Yaqub said:\n313\nThe meaning of\" \"recognize Allah through Allah\" is that Allah, the Mighty and High, created\npersons, colors, and substances. Therefore, the essences are bodies and the substances\nare spirits. He, the Mighty and High, resembles neither body nor spirit. Nobody has any\neffect or cause in creation of a sensitive, perceiving spirit. He is Matchless in the\ncreation of spirits, and bodies. Therefore, whoever negates from Him the two likenesses -\nthe likeness of bodies and the likeness of spirits - recognizes Allah through Allah. And\nwhoever views Him as a body, a spirit or a light, has not recognized Allah through Allah.\n6. Ahmad ibn Ziyad ibn Jafar al-Hamdani (RA) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim said, on the\nauthority of is father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Sinan, on the authority of Ziyad ibn alMundhar, on the authority of Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Ali al-Baqir (AS), on the authority of\nhis father, on the authority of his grandfather (AS) that\nVerily, a man stood before the Commander of the Faithful (AS) and asked, \"O\nCommander of the Faithful! With what did you recognize your Lord?\" He replied,\n\"Through abolishment of decision and invalidation of ambition. When I had an\nambition, something obstructed my ambition. And when I mad a decision, the Divine\nDecree opposed my decision. Hence, I came to know that the Planner was other than\nme.\" He asked, \"Then with what did you thank Him?\" He (AS) answered, \"I looked at a\ntribulation, which He took away from me, and with which he afflicted someone else.\nHence, I learned that He had bless me, and so I thanked Him.\" The man, asked, \"Why\ndo you desire to meet Him?\" Imam (AS) replied, \"When I saw him choosing the\nreligion of His angels, Messengers and Prophets (AS), I learned that He had honored\nme with this, and did not forget me. Hence, I desire to meet Him.\"\n314\n7. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Marwazi al-Muqri said: Abu Amr Muhammad\nibn Jafar al-Muqri said: Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Musili said in Baghdad that Muhammad\nibn Asim al-Tarifi said: Ayyash ibn Yazid ibn al-Hasanibn Ali al-Kahhal freed salve of Zayd\nibn Ali said: my father related to me that\nMusa ibn Jafar (AS) related to me that a group of people said to al-Sadiq (AS), \"We\npray but our prayers are not granted.\" He (AS) responded, \"If that is the case, it is\nbecause you pray to One whom you do not truly recognize.\"\n8. Al-Husayn ibn Ahmad ibn Idris (RA) said: my father said: Ibrahim ibn Hashim said, on the\nauthority of Muhammad ibn Abu Umayr, on the authority of Hisham ibn Salim that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) was asked, \"How did you recognize your Lord?' He (AS)\nreplied, \"Through abolishment of decision and invalidation of ambition. My decision\nwas abolished, and when I had an ambition it was invalidated.\"\n9. Al-Husayn ibn Ibrahim ibn Ahmad ibn Hisham al-Muaddab (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Abu\nAbd Allah al-Kufi said: Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Barmaki said: Muhammad ibn Abd alRahman al-Khazzaz al-Kufi said: Sulayman ibn Jafar said: Ali ibn al-Hakam said: Hisham ibn\nSalim said\n* \nI was in the presence of Muhammad ibn al-Muman al-Ahwal, when a man stood up\nbefore him, and asked him, \"How did you recognize your Lord?\" He replied, \"By means\nof His Direction, His Instruction, His Introduction, and His Guidance.\"\nHe says: I left his presence, and met with Hisham ibn al-Hakam, so I asked him, \"What\nshould I say to someone who asks me: how did you recognize your Lord?\"\nHisham relied, \"If someone asked me: what did you recognize your Lord with? I would\nsay: I recognized Allah, High be His Glory, though my own body as that is the thing\nwhich is the closest to me. Verily, my body is composed of assembled parts and\nformed of components which were created, the subject of intelligent design, and\nengineering. My body increases after decrease, and is reduced after enlargement. My\nbody has different senses, like sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, as well as\ndifferent limbs. My body was created in weakness, deficiency and contempt. None of\nthe sense can perceive the function of the other, nor do they have strength over others.\nThey are incapable of attracting benefits to themselves and preventing harm to\nthemselves. Wisdom dictates that it is impossible for something to be compiled without\na compiler, and that it is impossible for an image to be made without an artist. Thus, I\nlearned that my body has a Creator, and that my image was made by an Artist, Who is\ncontrary to them from all dimensions. Allah, the Mighty and High, has said: And in your\nown souls (too); will you not see.\n10. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Jafar Abu\nal-Husayn al-Asadi said: al-Husayn ibn al-Mamun al-Qarashi said, on the authority of Umr\nibn Abd al-Aziz, on the authority of Hisham ibn al-Hakam that\nAbu Shakir al-Daysani said to me: \"Verily, I have a query; I want you to take permission\nfor me from your companion. For I have certainly asked about it from many scholars.\n316\nThey have not been able to answer me with a satisfactory answer.\" So I said: \"Would\nyou like to tell me the query. Perhaps I have an answer that would please you.\"\nHe replied, \"I would certainly like to meet Abu Abd Allah (AS) with this query.\" So I\nobtained the permission for him and he entered his presence and asked him (AS), \"Do\nyou permit me to ask a question?\" The Imam (AS) replied, \"Ask what has come to you.\"\nHe asked, \"How can you prove that you have a Creator?\" Consequently, he (AS)\nresponded, I found myself not free from one of two possibilities: either I have crated\nmyself, or someone else has created me. If I have created myself, then I am not free\nfrom one of the two meanings: either I created myself while I was already existent, or I\ncreated myself while I was on nonexistent. Hence, if I created myself, and I already\nexited, then I was self-sufficient of giving existence to myself. And if I was\nnonexistent, then you know that the nonexistent cannot bring about a thing. Therefore,\nthe third meaning is proved that I have a Creator and that is Allah, the Lord of the\nUniverse.\nAl-Daysani got up and did not negate the answer.\nThe Compiler of this book says: The correct statement in this chapter is to say: we have\nrecognized Allah through Allah, because if we recognized Him through our intellects then\nHe, the Mighty and High, is the Bestower of our intellects. And if we recognized Him, the\nMighty and High, through His Prophets, Messengers and Proofs (AS) then He, the Mighty\nand High, is the One that delegates them, sends them, and the One who has taken\nthem as His Proofs. If we have recognized Him though ourselves then He, the Mighty and\nHigh, is the One who brought us about. Thus, through Him we have recognized Him.\nAl-Sadiq (AS) has said: \"If Allah did not exist then we (Imams) would not have been\nknown, and if we were not there, then Allah would not be recognized.\" The meaning of\nthat is that if the Proofs did not exist, then Allah would not be recognized the way He\ndeserves to be recognized, and if Allah did not exist, then the Proofs would not have\nbeen known.\nI have heard some theologians say: \"Even if a person were born in a desert on earth and\neven if he found nobody to guide him until he becomes big, contemplating the heaves\nand the earth would be sufficient to guide him to the fact that there is One Creator\nwho brought them about.\"\nI would respond: Verily, this is something that has not happened, and it relates the news of\nsomething that has not happened. If it has happened, how could it be? If such a thing\never took place, then that man must have been a Proof of Allah, may His Remembrance\nof Himself be Exalted, or a Prophet (AS). Allah sent different type of Prophets. Some\nwere individual Prophets, who were individually guided. Some were sent to their families,\nchildren. Some were sent to the people in their region. Some were sent to the people in\ntheir city. And some were sent to all of humanity.\nAs for the reasoning of Ibrahim (AS), the Friend of Allah, when he looked at Venus, the Moon,\nand the Sun, when they set he said: O people! Verily, I am free from the partners you\nascribe to Allah. He (AS) was a Prophet who had inspiration, was delegate and sent by\nAllah. All of his words were through the inspiration of Allah, the Mighty and High. As we\nsee in the Word of the Mighty and High: This is Our argument which We gave to\nAbraham rebutting his people.\nPeople are not all like Ibrahim (AS). If it were sufficient to simply think about Allah without\nthe guidance and Direction of Allah, the Mighty and High, then why did Allah, the Mighty\nand High, reveal what He revealed of His Word: So know that there is no god but\nAllah, and His Word: Say: He Allah is One, and His Word: Wonderful Originator of\nheavens and the earth! How could He have a son when He has no consort and He is\nthe Knower of subtleties, the Aware. Also the last verse of the chapter \"The\nBanishment,\" and other verses about Divine Unity.\n317\nChapter Forty -Two: Ithbat Huduth al-Alam. The Assertion of the\nEmergence of the Universe - 7 traditions\n1. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan Ahmad ibn al-Walid (may Allah have mercy o him) said:\nMuhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Saffar said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, on\nthe authority of al-Husayn ibn Said that Ali ibn Mansur related to me that I heard Hisham ibn\nal-Hakam that\nAbu Shakir al-Daysani entered the presence of Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) and said to\nhim, Verily, you are one of the shining stars, while your forefathers (AS) were brilliant\nfull-moons, and your foremothers were the wisest of women. Your origin is the most\nhonorable origins. When the learned are mentioned then you are at the top of the list.\nInform me, O Ocean (of Knowledge)! How can one prove the emergence of the\nuniverse?\" Abu Abd Allah (AS) answered, \"Through reason and by comparing it to the\nthings which are closest to us.\" He asked, \"What would that be?\" The reporter says:\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) asked for an egg and placed it on his palm and said: \"This is a\ncontainer. Inside its shell are the albumin, and the egg-yolk. With time, colorful peacock\nfeathers will burst out of it. Has anything entered it?\" He replied, \"No.\" The Imam (AS)\nsaid: \"Then this is a proof of the emergence of the universe.\" He responded, \"Your\nanswer is both nice an concise.

Are you created or not?\" He replied, \"No, I am not created.\" Al-Sadiq\n(AS) said to him, \"So, if you were created, then how would you be?\" The reporter says:\nIbn Au al-Awja' could not provide an answer. Therefore, he stood up and left.\n3. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya la-Attar said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said: Ibrahim in\nHashim said on the authority of Ali ibn Mabad, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Khalid that\nA man entered the presence (of Imam Abu al-Hasan Ali al-Rida) and said: \"O son of the\nMessenger of Allah (SA)! What is the proof that the universe emerged?\" He (AS)\nreplied, \"You did not exist, and yet you came into being. You already know that you\nhave not created yourself, and that you have not been created by someone like you.\"\n4. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: Muhammad ibn al-Hasan alSaffar said on the authority of Ibrahim ibn Hashim, on the authority of Muhammad ibn\nHammad, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Ibrahim, on the authority of Yunus ibn Abd alRahman, on the authority of Yunus ibn Yaqub that Ali ibn Mansur reported to me that\na\n319\n320\nHisham ibn al-Hakam reported to me that An atheist in Egypt was informed of some\nknowledge from Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) so he left for Medina to debate with him.\nHowever, he did not find him. It was said to him: \"He is in Mecca.\" So the atheist left for\nMecca. While we were with Abu Abd Allah (AS), the atheist came close to us while we\nwere circumambulating [tawaf] the Kabah. The atheist bumped shoulders with Abu\nAbd Allah (AS), so the Imam (AS) asked him \"What is your name?\"\nHe replied, \"My name is Abd al-Malik.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Then what is your agnomen [kunya]?\"\nHe answered, \"Abu Abd Allah.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked,\n\"Who is the Sovereign (al-Malik) whom you serve? Is He the Sovereign of the Heavens, or\nis he one of the sovereigns of the earth? And tell me about your son. Is the servant [abd]\nof the God of Heaven, or a god of the earth?\"\nThe atheist kept quiet.\nSo Abu Abd Allah (AS) continued, \"Say whatever you wish to, you will be defeated.\"\nHisham ibn al-Hakam says: Isaid to the atheist: \"Will you not refute him?\" Thus, he\ndisliked what I said.\nTherefore, Abu Abd Allah (AS) said to him, \"Once I complete the circumambulation,\ncome and see me.\"\nOnce Abu Abd Allah (AS) finished, the atheist came to him and sat down in front of\nhim, while we had gathered before him. Thus, he (AS) addressed the atheist, \"Do you\nknow that the earth has a top and a bottom?\"\nHe replied, \"I do not know, but I certainly think there is nothing below it.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said: \"Thinking [zann] is incapability unless you achieve certainty.\nHave you ascended to the heavens?\"\nHe answered, \"No.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked, Then do you know what is in it?\"\nHe replied, \"I do not.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Then have you been to the east and the west and seen what is\nbehind them?\"\nHe replied, \"No.\"\nThe Imam (AS) responded,\nHow strange! You have not been to the east or the west. You have not descended below\nthe earth. You have not ascended to heaven. You do not have any knowledge of what\nsurrounds them. However, you re in denial of what is in them. Does a wise man deny\nwhat he knows not?\"\nThe atheist said: \"No one but you has eve said such a thing to me.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said: \"You are in doubt as to whether He exist or not.\"\nThe atheist replied, \"That might be it.\"\nAbu Abd Allah said:\nO man! There is no authority for the one who knows over the one who knows not.\nLikewise, there is no authority for the ignorant over the learned. O my Egyptian brother!\nUnderstand this from me! We never doubt in Allah. Do you not see the sun and the\nmoon, and the night and day? They have recourse, but they do not make mistakes.\nThey come and they go. They are both compelled. There is not place for them except\ntheir own place. If they both had the power to leave, and not come back, then why do\nthey come back? If they both are not compelled, then why does the night change into\nthe day, and the day into night? By Allah, O Egyptian brother, they are both compelled\nto continue their routine. Surely, their Compeller is Wiser and Greater than they are!\"\nThe atheist said: \"You are right.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) then said:\n321\nO Egyptian brother! They way you atheists reason is wrong. Time does not bring\nanything into existence. If the passage of time can take then away, then why does it not\nreturn them? And if the passage of time can return them, when why does it not take\nthem away? They are compelled, O Egyptian brother! The sky has been raised, and the\nearth has been set down. Why is it that the sky does not collide with the earth? And\nwhy is it that the earth does not collide with the sky? Why is it that the earth does not\ngo out of its orbit? Who holds them together and who holds together what is between\nthem?\"\nThe atheist said: \"By Allah! Their Lord and their Master holds them together!\"\nThus, the atheist came to believe through his contact with Abu Abd Allah (AS). Humran\nibn Ayun said to him (AS). \"May I be your ransom! Atheist become believers through\nyou, just like the unbelievers use to become believer through your father (AS).\"\nThe believer, who had believed thanks to Abu Abd Allah (AS), said: \"Make me of your\nstudents.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said to Hisham ibn al-Hakam, \"Take him with you and teach\nhim.\"\nThus, Hisham taught him, and then he became the teacher of the Egyptians, and the\npeople of the northern region (Syria, Jordan, Palestine and Lebanon). He was trained\nspiritually and academically until Abu Abd Allah (AS) was pleased with it.\n5. My father and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (may Allah have mercy on\nthem) both said: Ahmad ibn Idris and Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar both said, on the\nauthority of Muhammad ibn Ahmad, on the authority of Sahl ibn Ziyad, on the authority of\nMuhammad ibn al-Husayn, on the authority of Ali ibn Yaqub al-Hashimi, on the authority of\nMarwan ibn Muslim that\nIbn Abu al-Awja' entered the presence of Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) and said: \"Do\nyou not claim that Allah is the Creator of Everything?\" Abu Abd Allah (AS) replied,\n\"Most certainly.\" He said: \"I also create.\" The Imam (AS) asked him, \"How do you\ncreate?\" He responded, \"I relieve my bowels in a place, then I stay away from it, and it\nmakes insects.

There is also one who\nis so hug that if ships were cast into the tears of its eyes, they could sail for the rest of\neternity. Blessed is Allah, the Best of the Creators.\nHe (AS) was questioned about the veils, so he answered,\nThe first of the veils are seven in number. The thickness of each veil is five hundred\nyears of travel. And the distance between the two veils is the distance traveled in five\nhundred years. The third veil is composed of seventy veils. Between each veil is the\ndistance traveled in five hundred years.

The\nstrength of each one of these angels is equal to the strength of all the jinn and men.\nThey are the source of darkness, light, fire, smoke, clouds, lightning, rain, thunder,\nglow, sand, mountain, dust, water and all rivers. There are different veils. The thickness\nof each one of these veils is the distance traveled over the course of seventy thousand\nyears.\nThen there are the Canopies of Glory [jalal], and there are seventy such canopies.

For I have certainly asked about it from many scholars.\n316\nThey have not been able to answer me with a satisfactory answer.\" So I said: \"Would\nyou like to tell me the query. Perhaps I have an answer that would please you.\"\nHe replied, \"I would certainly like to meet Abu Abd Allah (AS) with this query.\" So I\nobtained the permission for him and he entered his presence and asked him (AS), \"Do\nyou permit me to ask a question?\" The Imam (AS) replied, \"Ask what has come to you.\"\nHe asked, \"How can you prove that you have a Creator?\" Consequently, he (AS)\nresponded, I found myself not free from one of two possibilities: either I have crated\nmyself, or someone else has created me. If I have created myself, then I am not free\nfrom one of the two meanings: either I created myself while I was already existent, or I\ncreated myself while I was on nonexistent. Hence, if I created myself, and I already\nexited, then I was self-sufficient of giving existence to myself. And if I was\nnonexistent, then you know that the nonexistent cannot bring about a thing. Therefore,\nthe third meaning is proved that I have a Creator and that is Allah, the Lord of the\nUniverse.\nAl-Daysani got up and did not negate the answer.\nThe Compiler of this book says: The correct statement in this chapter is to say: we have\nrecognized Allah through Allah, because if we recognized Him through our intellects then\nHe, the Mighty and High, is the Bestower of our intellects. And if we recognized Him, the\nMighty and High, through His Prophets, Messengers and Proofs (AS) then He, the Mighty\nand High, is the One that delegates them, sends them, and the One who has taken\nthem as His Proofs. If we have recognized Him though ourselves then He, the Mighty and\nHigh, is the One who brought us about. Thus, through Him we have recognized Him.\nAl-Sadiq (AS) has said: \"If Allah did not exist then we (Imams) would not have been\nknown, and if we were not there, then Allah would not be recognized.\" The meaning of\nthat is that if the Proofs did not exist, then Allah would not be recognized the way He\ndeserves to be recognized, and if Allah did not exist, then the Proofs would not have\nbeen known.\nI have heard some theologians say: \"Even if a person were born in a desert on earth and\neven if he found nobody to guide him until he becomes big, contemplating the heaves\nand the earth would be sufficient to guide him to the fact that there is One Creator\nwho brought them about.\"\nI would respond: Verily, this is something that has not happened, and it relates the news of\nsomething that has not happened. If it has happened, how could it be? If such a thing\never took place, then that man must have been a Proof of Allah, may His Remembrance\nof Himself be Exalted, or a Prophet (AS). Allah sent different type of Prophets. Some\nwere individual Prophets, who were individually guided. Some were sent to their families,\nchildren. Some were sent to the people in their region. Some were sent to the people in\ntheir city. And some were sent to all of humanity.\nAs for the reasoning of Ibrahim (AS), the Friend of Allah, when he looked at Venus, the Moon,\nand the Sun, when they set he said: O people! Verily, I am free from the partners you\nascribe to Allah. He (AS) was a Prophet who had inspiration, was delegate and sent by\nAllah. All of his words were through the inspiration of Allah, the Mighty and High. As we\nsee in the Word of the Mighty and High: This is Our argument which We gave to\nAbraham rebutting his people.\nPeople are not all like Ibrahim (AS). If it were sufficient to simply think about Allah without\nthe guidance and Direction of Allah, the Mighty and High, then why did Allah, the Mighty\nand High, reveal what He revealed of His Word: So know that there is no god but\nAllah, and His Word: Say: He Allah is One, and His Word: Wonderful Originator of\nheavens and the earth! How could He have a son when He has no consort and He is\nthe Knower of subtleties, the Aware. Also the last verse of the chapter \"The\nBanishment,\" and other verses about Divine Unity.",

There is no authority for the one who knows over the one who knows not.\nLikewise, there is no authority for the ignorant over the learned. O my Egyptian brother!\nUnderstand this from me! We never doubt in Allah. Do you not see the sun and the\nmoon, and the night and day? They have recourse, but they do not make mistakes.\nThey come and they go. They are both compelled.

If they both are not compelled, then why does the night change into\nthe day, and the day into night? By Allah, O Egyptian brother, they are both compelled\nto continue their routine.

His\nabode is Hell, and it is the worst place of arrival.\nThe Compiler of this book says, we believe: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has\npredestined and decreed the good and evil of His Servants, and all that is in the universe. The\ndecree can be in the meaning of information, like Allah, the Mighty and High says: And We\nhad decreed to the children of Israel in the Book. He means that We made known to them.\nLike Allah, the Mighty and High, says: And We revealed to him this decree, that the roots\nof these shall be cut off in the morning. He means that We informed him and made it\nknown to him. Therefore, it cannot be refused that Allah the Mighty and High, decrees the\nactions of the servants and all that which is of good and evil in this meaning, because Allah, the\nMighty and High, is the Knower of it all.\nIt is correct that He may give knowledge to any of His servants and inform them of it. The\ndecree can also be in the meaning of writing and informing, like Allah, the Mighty and High,\nsays: Except his wife; We decreed that she shall surely be of those who remain behind;\ni.e. We prescribed and informed. Al-Ajjaj said:\nBe informed that the Glorified has decree\nIn the earlier scriptures that He wrote.\nHe decreed' means He wrote.\nThe decree can sometimes be in the meaning of the rule and necessity. Allah, the Mighty and\nHigh, says: And your Lord has destined that you shall not serve (any) but Him, and\ngoodness to your parents. He means that He has ordained that and made it necessary on\nHis Creation. It may also be possible to say that Allah, the Mighty and High, has destined the\nactions of the servants in this meaning. What He made necessary for His Servants and\nordered them to do are obligations.\nIt is also possible that the meaning is: Allah has set a measurement for the actions of the\nservants to explain its measurements and states of good and evil, obligatory and\nsupererogatory, and other things. He gives reasons fro what makes the states of these actions\nrecognized.\nTherefore, the Mighty and High is the One that sets the measurements, but to explain them to\nother than Himself who do not know the state of what He has destined in their measurements.\nThis is apparent and not hidden. It is very clear that it does not require any proofs over it. Is it\nnot so that when we go to the skilled people in measurements, their knowledge of\nmeasurements does not stop them from setting measurements to explain to us their\nmeasurements?\nVerily, we reject that Allah, the Mighty and High, has ordained His Servants with this and\nforbidden them from abstention from this. Or that He has done it and created it. As Allah, the\nMighty and High, has created them a measured creation, so we do not reject that.\nI heard some learned ones says: Verily, the destiny [al-Qada'] has ten different meanings: The\nfirst of them is to know' according to the Word of Alah, the Mighty and High: But (it was only) a\ndesire in the soul of Yaqub which he destined, i.e. He knew.\nThe second meaning is to inform' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And We had\ndecreed to the children of Israel in the Book, and the Word of the Mighty and High: And We\nrevealed to him this decree, i.e. We informed him.\nThe third is to judge' according to the Word of the Mighty and High is: And Allah decrees\nwith the truth, i.e. He judges with the truth.\nThe fourth is to say' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And Allah decrees\nwith the truth, i.e. He says the truth.\nThe firth is to determine definitely' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: But when\nWe decreed death for him, i.e. We determined definitely. So I is the definite decree.\nThe sixth is to command' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And your Lord has\ndestined that you shall not serve (any) but Him, i.e. your Lord has commanded.\nThe seventh is to create' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: So He decreed them\nseven heavens in two periods, i.e. he created them.\nThe eight is to do' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Therefore, decree what\nyou are going to decree, i.e. do what you are doing.\nThe ninth is to accomplish' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: So when Musa\nhad decreed the term; and the Word of the Mighty and High, accounting Musa Whichever\nof the two terms I decree, there shall be no wrongdoing to me; and Allah is a witness of\nwhat we say, i.e. I accomplish.\nThe tenth is to conclude from something' according to the Word of the Mighty and High The\nmatter is decreed concerning which you enquired, i.e. it is concluded from it for you two. It\nis the Word of a person what I have decreed your requirement for you, i.e. I have concluded it\nfor you.\nTherefore, it is possible to say that the things in their entirety are with the destiny of Allah and\nHis Decree, Blessed and Exalted be He. This is in the meaning that Allah, the Mighty and\nHigh, knows it and know it measures, and that He has a judgment for all of it, either the good\nor evil.\nTherefore, whatever is good He decreed it in the meaning that He commanded it, determined\nit definitely, and made it true. He knew its extent and measure. Whatever is evil, He did not\ncommand it, and is not pleased with it. However, He destined it, and decreed it in the sense\nthat He knows its measure and extent, and has judged according to His Judgement.\nThe word [al-fitnah] has ten different meanings: One of them is misguidance.'\nThe second is to put to the test' according to the Word of Allah: And We tried you with (a\nsevere) trying, i.e. We have put you to a test; and the Word of the Mighty and High: Do men\nthink that they will be left alone on saying, We believe, and not be tried? i.e. they will not\nbe put to a test.\nThe third is to make excuse' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Then their\nexcuse would be nothing but that they would say: By Allah, our Lord, we were not\npolytheists.\nThe fourth is to believe in polytheism' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And\npolytheism is severer than murder.\nThe fifth is to disbelieve' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Surely into trial have\nthey already tumbled down, i.e. into disbelief.\nThe sixth is to burn with fire' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Surely (as for) those\nwho persecute the believing men and the believing women, i.e. they burn.\nThe seventh is to punish' according the Word of the Mighty and High: (It is) the day on\nwhich they shall be tried at the fire, i.e. they shall be punished. The Word of the Mighty and\nHigh: Taste your trial! This is what you would hasten on, i.e. your punishment. And the\nWord of the Mighty and High: And as for him whose trial Allah desired, you cannot\ncontrol anything fro him with Allah, i.e. whose punishment.\nThe eight is to kill' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: If you fear that hose who\ndisbelieve will cause you distress, i.e. if you fear that they will kill you. Also the Word of the\nMighty and High: But none believed in Musa except the offspring of his people, on\naccount of the fear of Firawn and their chiefs, lest he should persecute them, i.e. he\nmay kill them.\nThe ninth is to turn away' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And surely they\nhad purposed to try you in that which We have revealed to you, i.e. to turn you away.\nThe tenth is a severe trial' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Our Lord! Do not\nmake us a trial for those who disbelieve. And the Word of the Mighty and High is: Our\nLord! Make us not subject to the persecution of the unjust people, i.e. a severe trial with\nwhich they may cause mischief.\nThey say about themselves: Nothing has killed them except the fact that their religion is void,\nand our religion is true. Therefore, it invites them to Hell due to their disbelief and oppression.\nAli ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim has added to these ten meanings another possibility that one of\nthe meanings of the word fitnah is love according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And\nknow that your property and your children are a temptation, i.e. love. In my opinion, there are\nten meanings to this verse. Fitnah is this context means a severe trial' and not love.\nThe confirmation of that is the tradition of the Prophet (SA), \"The son, takes after the father in\nignorance, trial and miserliness.\"\nI have extracted this tradition with transmission in the book Maqtal al-Husayn ibn Ali,\nblessings be upon them both.",

When the Day of Judgment\ncomes and Allah, the Mighty and High, assembles creation to deliver His Judgment. He\nwill bring forth the children of the monotheists, and will ask them:\n\"O My Servants! Who is your Lord? What is your religion? And what deeds have you\nbrought forth?\"\nThey will reply:\n\"O our Allah, our Lord, You created us, while we did no create anything.

And with the same chain of transmission: on the authority of Hammad ibn Uthman, on the\nauthority of Amir ibn Abd Allah that\n\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said,\nOn the grave of Ibrahim, son of the Messenger of Allah (SA), there was a branch that\nshaded it from sunlight. By the time the branch dried up, the marks of the grave had\nvanished and its place was not know.\nHe (AS) also added,\nWhen Ibrahim, son of the Messenger of Allah (SA) died, he was eighteen months old.\nTherefore, Allah, the Mighty and High, had his suckling period completed in Paradise.\nThe Compiler of this book says concerning children and their state: Verily, the process of\nrecognizing justice and injustice, and the way of differentiation between the two or aversion\nfrom them, is not something innate. In fact, it is due to the approval or disapproval of the\nintellect. Therefore, it is not permissible for us to refuse the evil of an action due to our\nignorance of its causes. Nor should we take it out from the boundary of justice based on its\napparent from. Rather the method, when we intend to understand the reality of a category of\nactions that is hidden to us, should be the rational one. We should turn to proofs that indicate\nthe wisdom of their doers, and we should be devoted to proofs that introduce us to the state of\nits doer. If He acts wisely and justly, then it must necessarily apply to all of His actions,\nwhether or not we are ignorant of their causes. This is because, as far as the intellect is\nconcerned, there is no shortcoming in one category of actions without the other, or\nspecification for one genus without the other.\nTake the case of a father, for example, who we know to be just. If he amputates a limb from\nhis son for a reason that we are ignorant of, we cannot declare that he is unjust since we are\nunaware of the reason for which he did so. As a whole, this is due to his fair appearance and\ngood intent for his son.\nThe actions of Allah, the All-Knowing of the ends and beginnings, are similar, Blessed and\nExalted be Hi. Reason requires us to believe that His Actions must be wise and just. We\ncannot limit ourselves to what we know because we are ignorant of all the details which\nmotivate His Actions. We understand that we are unable to understand the causes of all\nthings, since we do not understand them in full. This is when we intend to understand a\nsentence that enables its ignorance from the rules of His Actions, the Mighty and High.\nHowever, if we intend to explore its meanings and discuss its causes then we are not short of\nintellects, with the praise of Allah, that may make us recognize the rational reasoning in their\ndetails, what confirms the indication on a whole. The proof that the actions of Allah, the\nBlessed and Exalted, are based on wisdom is that they are far form contradiction and secure\nfrom differentiation.\nThe proof can also be found in their interconnectedness, the need of things to their likes, and\nthe damaging of its shape and connecting of every category to its resemblance until it is\nimagined that it is other than what is seems. The rotation of the heavens and the movement of\nthe sun and the moon, and the travel of the stars would certainly obliterate and be destroyed.\nThus, when the actions of Allah, the Mighty and High, execute what we have mentioned\nregarding the reasons for justice and injustice, we can only conclude that they are based on\nwisdom. The proof the Mighty and High does not oppress can be found in the fact hat He,\nBlessed and Exalted, is Eternal, Self-Sufficient, and All-Knowing. Furthermore, He cannot act\nignorantly.\nOppression only occurs among the ignorant or those who seek personal benefit. Since He, the\nBlessed and Exalted, is Eternal and Self-Sufficient, He does not benefit or lose anything fro\nknowing what was, and what will be good and evil. Everything He does is out of wisdom, and\neverything He does is Right. Do you to see that those who are wise do not commit evil, as he\nhas sufficient self-control to refrain from evil. Whoever commits a major sin deserves criticism.\nTherefore, the existence of evil is not feared from Him and this is clear. All praise is due to\nAllah.",

As for the good-doers, they should not be concerned.\"\nIbn Abu Umayr says: I asked him, O son of the Messenger of Allah! How can\nintercession apply to those who commit major sins, when Allah, exalted be His\nRemembrance, says: And they do not intercede except for him whom He approves and\nfor fear of Him they tremble; and whoever commits major sins cannot be the approved\none, Thus, he (AS) responded, O Abu Ahmad! There is not a believer who commits a sin\nbut that it grieves him, and he regrets it. The Prophet (SA) has said: \"Regret is\nsufficient for repentance.\" He (AS) has also said: Whoever is pleased by his good\ndeeds and grieved by his bad deeds is a believer.\" Therefore, he who commits a sin,\nand does not regret it, is not a believer, and intercession will not apply to him because\nhe is unjust. Allah, exalted be His Remembrance, says: The unjust shall not have nay\ncompassionate friend nor any intercessor who should be obeyed.\nI asked him, \"O son of the Messenger of Allah! Why is a person an unbeliever is he\ndoes not feel any remorse for his sins?\" He (AS) replied, O Abu Ahmad! If someone\nknows that he has committed a major sin, and knows that he will be punished for it, he\nwill surely regret his action. If feels remorse, he has repented, and deserves\nintercession. If he does not regret his action, he will persist in his sin. Persistent,\nhabitual sinners are not forgiven, because they do not believe that they will be\npunished for their actions. If they believed in the punishment then surely they would\nregret their action. The Prophet (SA) said: No major sin remains after repentance. And\nno sin remains minor if one engages in it habitually. As for the Word of Allah, the\nMighty and High: And they do not intercede except for him whom He approves; then he\nwill not receive intercession unless Allah approves his belief. Belief is the confirmation\nof reward for good deeds and punishment over bad deeds. If Allah accepts a person's\nfaith as sincere, it is because the person regrets the sins he has committed, and fears\ntheir punishment on the Day of Judgment.",

Now go and pray. They way,\nthey will learn what they should do when this happens to them. It is not as they say:\nWhen one sleeps in and misses a prayer, he is lost.' The same applies to fasting.

A Session of al-Rida (AS)\nwith Theologians from Among the Rhetoricians and Various\nReligions about Unity in the presence of al-Mamun - 1 tradition\n\n1. Abu Muhammad Jafar ibn Ali ibn Ahmad the jurist resident of Qum then of al-Iylaq (RA)\nsaid: Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Sadaqah al-Qummi reported to us\nthat Abu Amr Muhammad ibn Umar ibn Abd Aziz al-Ansari al-Kajji related to me that one\nwho heard from al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali al-Hashimi related to me that\n\nWhen Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS) came to see al-Mamun, al-Mamun ordered al-Fadl ibn\nSahl to summon the prominent theologians from among the rhetoricians such as the\nCatholicos [al-jathaliq]. The Head of the Rabbis [ras al-jalut], the heads of the Sabians,\nthe High Priest [al-hirbidh] of Zoroaster and his followers, Castile Nestus, the Roman\nmedical scientist, and the rest of the theologians in order to hear their words and those\nof al-Rida (AS). Al-Fadl ibn Sahl gathered them together, then informed al-Mamun\nabout their meeting. Al-Mamun said: Let them enter my presence.' So he did, and then\nreceived them with hospitality.\nHe then introduced himself to them saying, Verily, I have gathered you for something\ngood, and want you to debate with this cousin of mine from medina, who has come\ntome. Come to me tomorrow morning. None of you should be absent.\"\nThey said: \"O Commander of the Faithful! We listen and obey you. Allah willing,, we will\nbe here first thing in the morning.\"\nAl-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said: \"We were talking to Abu al-Hasan (AS) when\nYasir, the servant who was in the charge of serving Abu al-Hasan, entered and told him,\nO My Master! Verily, the Commander of the Faithful expressed his greetings to you and\nsaid: May you brother be your ransom! Verily, the rhetoricians, scholars from all\nreligions, and theologians from all nations have all gathered together here with me.\nWould you like to come to us and have a discussion with them? If you do not wish to\ndo so, do not bother yourself. However, if you prefer, we can come visit you.\n\nAbu al-Hasan (AS) then said: \"Express my greetings to him, and tell him that I\nunderstand what you intend. Allah willing, I will come to you myself tomorrow\nmorning.\"\nAl-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali said; \"When Yasir went out, the Imam (AS) turned\nto me and said: \"O Nawfali! You are an Iraqi, and an Iraqi's heart is not hard. So, what\ndo you think? What is your cousin's intention in setting up a meeting between me and\nthe pagans and rhetoricians?\"\nAl-Nawfali says I answered, \"May I be yoiur ransom! He intends to test you, and wants\nto know how much knowledge you possess. Verily, he has based his assumption on\nshaky grounds. By Allah, what he has set up is evil.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked, \"And what has he set up?\"\nAl-nawfali said:\nThe heretics and the theologians are different from the learned. That is because a\nlearned does not deny the undeniable, whereas rhetoricians, theologians, and\npolytheists are people who deny things and try to prove what is not true. If you argue\nwith them and tell them that God is One, they would say, Confirm His Oneness.' And if\nyou say that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, they would say, Prove his\nProphethood.' May I be your ransom! They confuse you and make you disprove your\nown proofs. They continue to falsify until you back off. Beware of them! May I be your\nransom!\"\nAl-Nawfali added, \"The Imam (AS) then smiled, and told me, O Nawfali! Do you fear that\nthey will defeat my arguments?\"\nAl-Nawfali said: No, by Allah! I have no worries about you. Allah willing, I hope that\nAllah will make you victorious over them!'\nThe Imam (AS) asked again, O Nawfali! Would you like to know when Al-Mamun will\nregret his actions?\"\nHe answered, Yes.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said:\nWhen he hears me argue with the people of the Torah quoting their own Torah, with the\npeople of the Gospel quoting their own Gospel with the people of the Psalms quoting\ntheir own Psalms, with the Sabians in their own Hebrew language, with the Zoroastrian\npriests in their own Persian, and with the Romans in their own Latin, and with the\nrhetoricians using their very own languages.\nSo, if I close the avenues of argument in the face of each arguing party and disprove\nhis claim, making him renounce his statement from its onset and referring to my own\nstatement, then al-Mamun will realize that he has not achieved what he aspires to\nachieve. It is then that he will feel regret. And there is no power and no strength save in\nAllah, the Most High, the Most Great.\nOn the following day, al-Fadl ibn Sahl went in a hurry to see the Imam (AS) and told\nhim, \"May I be your ransom! Your cousin is waiting for you. The people have gathered\ntogether. When will you go to him?\"\nAl-Rida (AS) told him, \"You go ahead, Allah willing, I will come to you.\"\nThen he made ablutions for praying, drank some sawiq, quenched us from it as well, and\nthen we all left. When we reached al-Mamun's place, the meeting was full of\npeople. Muhammad ibn Jafar, some of the Talibites and Hashimites, and the\nCommanders of the Army were among those present.\nWhen al-Rida (AS) entered, al-Mamun stood up, Muhammad ibn Jafar, and all the\nHashimites who were present there, also stood up for him. The Imam (AS) and alMamun sat down while all the people were still standing, until al-Mamun ordered them\nto sit down. Al-Mamun talked to the Imam for a while. Then al-Mamun turned to the\nCatholicos and said: \"O Catholicos! This is my cousin Ali ibn Musa ibn Jafar (AS). He\nis one of the children of Fatimah (AS), the daughter of our Prophet (SA), and Ali ibn\nAbu Talib (AS). I would like you to debate with him, but be fair with him.\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"O Commander of the Faithful! How can I argue with a man who\nargues with me using a Book I reject, and who believes in a prophet who I do not\nbelieve in?\nAl-Rida (AS) told him, \"O Christian! Will you accept to debate with me if I present proofs\nfrom your Gospel?\"\nThe Catholicos answered, \"How could I reject the words of the Bible? I swear to God\nthat I will accept your arguments, even if I dislike them.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) told him, \"Ask whatever you wish, and you shall receive an answer.\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"what is your opinion about the Prophethood of Jesus and his\nBook? Do you deny either one of them?\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said:\nI accept the Prophethood of Jesus. I accept his Book. And I accept what he taught his\nnation, and what was accepted by his disciples. However, I reject the Prophethood of\nany Jesus who has not professed the Prophethood of Muhammad, his Book, and\nwhat he taught his people.\nThe Catholicos said: \"Two witnesses are required to validate a testimony. Is that\ncorrect?\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Yes.\"\nThe Catholicos Archbishop said: \"if that is the case, I challenge you to select who\nwitnesses who are neither Muslim nor Christina, but who do not reject the Prophethood\nof Muhammad (SA). Likewise, you may ask a similar question from people other than\nour own nation.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"O Christian! Now you are speaking fairly. Do you accept a just\nperson who was given preference (over others) by the Messiah, Jesus, the son of\nMary?\"\nThe Catholicos replied, \"Who is the just one? Name him for me.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"What is your opinion of John al-Daylami?\"\nThe Catholicos responded, \"Bravo! Bravo! You have mentioned the person most loved\nby the Messiah.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said:\nThen I ask you to swear by God, and tell me whether or not the Bible says that John\nsaid: The Messiah has informed me of the religion of Muhammad, the Arab, and has\ngiven me the glad tidings about him who will be (a Prophet) after him. Therefore, I have\nthe glad tidings of him to the disciples and they believed in him.'\nThe Catholicos said: \"John did quote this from the Messiah. He did give the glad\ntidings concerning the coming of a Prophet, his Household, and his Successor. He has\nnot specified when this would happen, and has not named them so that we could\nidentify them.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"If we bring someone here who can recite the Bible, and he recites to\nyou Muhammad's name, his Household, and his nation, will you believe in him?\"\nThe Catholicos replied, \"What a sound suggestion!\"\nAl-Rida (AS) turned to Nestus the Roman, and asked hi, \"have you memorized the third\nBook of the Bible?\"\nHe answered, \"I have thoroughly memorized it.\" Then the Imam (AS) addressed the\nCatholicos and said: \"Can you recite the Bible?\" The Catholicos said: \"Yes, of course.\"\nThe Imam said: \"Then I will recite to you (some verses from) the third Book. If\nMuhammad (SA), his Household (AS), and his nation were mentioned in it, then bear\nwitness! And if they have not been mentioned therein, then do not bear witness.\"\nThen the Imam (AS) recited to him some of the verses of the third Book until he reached\nthe reference to the Prophet. He stopped reading and said: \"O Christina! I challenge\nyou to swear by the Messiah and his mother. Have you realized that I have knowledge\nof the Bible?\"\nHe replied, \"yes.\"\nThe Imam (AS) recited to him some verses from the third Book concerning the\nreference to the Prophet, his Household, and his nation. Then the Imam (AS) said:\nO Christian! What do you think now? These are the words of Jesus, the son of Mary. If\nyou deny what the Bible says, then you will deny both the Jesus and Moses. If you deny\nthem, then it is incumbent to kill you for blasphemy against your Lord, your Prophet,\nand your Book.\nThe Catholicos said: \"I do not deny the clear things in the Bible. On the contrary, I\nprofess them.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked others who were present, \"Bear witness to his profession.\"\nThen the Imam (AS) said to the Catholicos, \"O Catholicos! Ask me any other question\nthat you wish to ask.\"\nThe Catholicos asked, \"What about the disciples of Jesus, the son of Mary? How many\nwere they? And tell me about the scholars of the Bible. How many were then?\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said:\nYou have found the expert! As for (the number of) the disciples, they were twelve men.\nThe best and the most learned of them was Aluqas (Luke). As for the (number of)\nChristian scholars, there were three men: John (Yohanna), the great' at Aj, John at\nQirqisiya, and john al-Daylami at Zijan, who made reference to Prophet Muhammad, his\nHousehold and his nation. It is he who gave glad tidings to the nation of Jesus and\nthe Children of Israel about him.\nThe Imam (AS) added, \"O Christian! By Allah, we believe in Jesus, who believed in\nMuhammad. We have nothing against Jesus except for his weakness and the paucity of\nhis fasting and prayer.\nThe Catholicos replied, \"By Allah, you have corrupted your knowledge! You affair has\nbecome weak! I though that you were the most learned of the Muslims!\"\nAl-Rida (AS) asked, \"Why?\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"You said that Jesus was weak in fasting and prayer when, in fact,\nhe never broke fasting during the day, and never slept during the night. He always\nfasted during the day, and he always prayed throughout the night.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"For whom did he fast and pray?\"\nThe Catholicos did no answer, not knowing what to say.\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"I want to ask you a question.\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"Ask. I will respond if I have the answer.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) asked, \"Why do you deny that Jesus gave life to the dead with the\npermission of Allah, the Mighty and High?\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"I deny that because whoever is able to give life to the dead, and\nto heal the blind and the leprous is a Lord worthy of service.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said:\nVery well. However, Elijah [al-Yasa'] performed the same miracles as Jesus did. He\nwalked on water, gave life to the dead, and healed the blind and the leprous Why did his\nnation not adopt him as a Lord? Why did no anyone worship him as a god other than\nAllah? The Prophet Ezekiel [Hizqil] did just what Jesus did. He gave life to thirty-five\nmen sixty years after their death.\nThen the Imam (AS) turned towards the Head of the Rabbis and asked him,\nO Head of the Rabbis! Do you find the following about some of the youth of the\nChildren of Israel in the Torah? When Nebuchadnezzar [Bakht Nasr] invaded Jerusalem,\nhe enslaved the Children of Israel and brought them to Babylonia. Then Allah, the\nMighty and High, sent al-Yasa from them, and he gave life to them. This is in the Torah.\nNo one but an unbeliever of you would deny it.\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"I have heard about this and know it.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"You have spoken the truth.\"\nThen the Imam (AS) said: \"O Jewish man! See if I read from the following Book of the\nTorah properly.\"\nThe Imam (AS) then recited some of the verses from the Torah for us. The Jewish man,\nwho was surprised at hearing how the Imam (AS) was reciting the Torah, kept moving\nhis body.\nHe then faced the Christian and asked, \"O Christian! Were these words revealed before\nJesus or were they revealed after him?\"\nThe Catholicos answe3red, \"They were revealed before him.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said:\nThe people of Quraysh gathered around the Messenger of Allah (SA) and asked him to\ngive life to their dead. He sent along Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) with them and told him, \"go\nto the cemetery, and loudly call the people about whom they have asked, say, \"O so-andso, so-and-so, etc.\" Tell them, \"Allah's Messenger Muhammad says, Rise with the\npermission of Allah, the Mighty and High' Then they all rose and brushed off the dust\nfrom their heads.\" The people from the tribe of Quraysh walked towards them and\nasked them about their affairs. They told them that Muhammad (SA) has been raised as\na Prophet. The people who had risen from the dead said: \"We wish we had lived in his\nage and believed in him!\" He healed the blind, the leprous, and the insane. He spoke\nwith the beasts, the birds, the jinn, and demons. Still, we do not adopt him as a Lord\nother than Allah, the Mighty and High. We do not deny the miracles of the prophets.\nSince you have adopted Jesus as a Lord, why do you not adopt al-Yasa and Hizqil as\nlords, for they performed the same miracles as did Jesus, the son of Mary, such as\ngiving life to the dead?\nMoreover, thousands of the Children of Israel left their homeland in fear of death due to\nthe plague. Allah made them die immediately. The people of the village build a fence\naround them, and left them there until their bones decayed. One of the prophets of the\nChildren of Israel passed by, and he was amazed when he saw so may decayed bones.\nAllah, the Mighty and high, revealed to him, \"Would you like Me to bring them to life so\nthat you can admonish them?\"\nThe Prophet said: \"Yes, O Lord!\" Then Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed to him,\n\"Then call them.\" He said: \"O decayed bones! Rise with Allah's permission.\" They all\nrose while brushing off the dust from their heads.\"\nLikewise when Abraham (AS), the friend of the Most Compassionate, took the birds, cut\nthem into pieces, and put each piece on a mountain top. He called out to them and they\ncame towards him.\nAlso Moses (AS) the son of Imran, his companions, and seventy of the men whom he\nhad chosen went to the mountain. They told Moses, \"You have seen Allah. So show\nHim to us like you have seen Him.\" Moses told them, \"I have not seen Him.\" But they\nsaid: \"We shall never believe in you until we see Allah manifestly.\" A thunderbolt struck\nthem, and burned them all up. Only Moses survived. Moses said: O my Lord! I chose\nseventy men from among the Children of Israel and brought them to the mountain.\nShall I return by myself? How shall my people believe what I must tell them? If You\ndesired You could have destroyed al of us long before. Would you destroy us all for the\ndeeds of the foolish ones among us?' Then Allah, the Mighty and High, gave life to\nthem after their death.\nYou cannot deny all these things which I have told you, for the Torah, the Bible, the\nPsalms and the Qur'an have mentioned them. If all those who gave life to the dead,\nhealed the blind, the leprous and the mad, were adopted as lords other than Allah, then\nyou should also adopt them as Lords. O Christians! What is your opinion?\nThe Catholicos said: \"Yes. You are right. There is no god but Allah.\"\n\nThen the Imam (AS) turned towards the Head of the Rabbis and told him.\nO Jewish man! Turn to me. Swear to me by the Ten Commandments which were sent\ndown to Moses, the son of Imran, that the following statement about the Prophet\nMuhammad (SA) and his nation is not found in the Torah:\nWhen the people of the last nation, who are followers of the Rider of the Camel, who\nglorifies the Lord enormously, new glorification in new churches (implying mosques),\nthen let the Children of Israel flee towards them and their dominion so that their hearts\nmay be tranquil, since there will be swords in their hands with which they will take\nrevenge on the unbelievers around the globe.\nIs this not written in the Torah?\nThe Head of the Rabbis said; \"Yes, we have found that written in this manner.\"\nThen the Imam (AS) asked the Catholicos, \"O Christian! How is your knowledge of the\nBook of Shaya?\nHe answered, \"I know it letter by letter.\"\nThen the Imam asked them both, \"Do you know that the following statement is made by\nhim, O people! I have seen the picture of the Donkey. He was wearing gowns of light.\nAnd I have seen the Rider of the Camel, who is as bright as the moon.'\"\nThey answered, \"Verily, Sha1ya did say that!\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said:\nO Christian! Do you know that Jesus said:\nI am going to my Lord and your Lord, and the Paraclete [farqilita] is coming who shall\ntestify to my truth just as I testified for him, and he shall explain everything to you, and\nhe shall be the one to expose all the sins of nations, and he shall be the one to smash\ndown the pillars of unbelief?'\nThe Catholicos said: \"We accept whatever you cite from the Bible.\"\nThe Imam said: \"O Catholicos! Have you found this in the Bible?\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"Yes.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"O Catholicos, when you lost the first Bible, with whom did you find\nit?\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"We only lost the Bible for one day. Then we found it fresh (in its\noriginal state). John and Matthew brought it back to us.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) asked him,\nHow little you know of the Bible and its scholars! If what you say is correct, then why\ndo you have so many disputes between yourselves regarding the Bible? The source of\ncontroversy lies in the Bible which you have in your hands today. Had it been the same\nas the fist Bible, there would be no dispute over it, However, I will prove this for you\nmyself.\nKnow that when the first Bible was lost, the Christians gathered around their scholars\nand said to them, Jesus the son of Mary has been killed, and we have lost the Bible.\nYou are the scholars. What do you have?' Luke, Mark and John told them, We have\nmemorized the Bible. Do not worry about it. Do not forsake the churches. We will recite\neach Gospel of the Bible for you on each Sunday until we put it all together.' Then Luke,\nMark, John and Matthew gathered together and put together this Bible after you had\nlost the first one. These four students were of the first students. Did you know that?\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"I did not know this before. Now I have learned it from you due to\nyour noble knowledge of the Bible. I heard things from you which I knew deep down,\nand which my heart acknowledges to be the truth. As a result, I have grown in\nunderstanding.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"Do you accept the evidence I have presented?\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"I completely accept the evidence as correct, and bear witness\nthat it is true.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) then told al-Ma'mun, his family, and the others who were present, \"Be\nwitnesses to this.\" They said: \"We bear witness.\"\nThen the Imam (AS) told the Catholicos,\nI swear by the Son and his Mother to tell us whether you know that Matthew said the\nfollowing, The Messiah is the son of David, the son of Abraham, the son of Issac, the\nson of Jacob, the son of Yehuda, the son of Khadrun.'\nMark said the following regarding the lineage of Jesus, the son of Mary, He is Allah's\nWord placed in the human body. So it turned into the human form.'\nMoreover, Luke said: Jesus the son of Mary and his mother wee humans made of flesh\nand blood. Then the Holy Sprit entered into them.'\nTestify as well that Jesus said the following about himself, O disciples! I will tell you\nthe truth. No one will ascend to Heaven, except for him who descends there from, except\nfor the Rider of the Camel, the Seal of the Prophets, for he will ascend to the Heavens,\nand then will descend therefrom.\nWhat do you have to say about that?\nThe Catholicos said; \"These are the words of Jesus. We do not deny them.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"If so, what do you say about the testimonies of Luke, Mark and\nMatthew regarding Jesus and the lineage they attributed to him?\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"They ascribed likes to Jesus.\"\nA (A) said: \"O people! Did he not just bear witness that they (Luke, Mark and\nMatthew) are the Scholars of the Bible, and what they said was the truth?\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"O Scholar of the Muslims! I would like you to excuse me from\ndiscussing about these men.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"Fine, I will excuse you from that, O Christian! Ask me whatever you\nwish to ask.\"\nThe Catholicos said: \"Let someone else ask you questions. By Jesus, I did not think\nthat there was a scholar like you among the Muslims.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) turned towards the Head of the Rabbis and said: \"Will you ask me\nquestions or should I ask?\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"I will ask. However, I will not accept any proofs from you\nexcept those form the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms of David, or the Scriptures of\nAbraham and Moses.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"Do not accept any of my proofs unless they are from the Torah as\nexpressed by Moses, the son of Imran, the Bible as expressed by Jesus, the son of\nMary, or the Psalms of David as expressed by David.\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"How can you prove the Prophethood of Muhammad\n\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"Moses, the son of Imran, Jesus, the son of Mary and David, the\nVicegerent of Allah on the Earth, have testified to his Prophethood.\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"Provide evidence of the testimony of Moses, the son of\nImran.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) told him,\nO Jewish man! Do you know that Moses said the following to the Children of Israel, A\nprophet will come to you fro among your brethren. Believe in him, and obey him.'\nDo you know that the Children of Israel have no brethren other than the Children of\nIshamel? Do you know about the ties of kinship between Israel and Ishmael and the\nrelationship that existed between them from the past through Abraham?\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"These are the words of Moses. I do not deny them.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) asked him, \"Has any Prophet other than Muhammad (SA) come from\namong the brethren of the Children of Israel?\"\nHe replied, \"No.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"Is this not correct in your opinion?\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"Yes, but I want you to prove its correctness from the\nTorah.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) asked him, \"Do you deny that the Toray says the following to you? There\ncame light from Mount Sinai. Light shined upon us from Mount Sair and it became\napparent to us from Mount Faran.'\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"I am familiar with these words, but I do not know what\nthey mean.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said:\nI will inform you about them. What is meant when it says There came light from Mount\nSinai is a reference to the revelations of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, to Moses on\nmount Sinai.\nAnd what is meant when it says, Light shined upon us from Mount Sair' is a reference\nto the mountain upon which Allah, the Mighty and High, sent revelations of Jesus, the\nson of Mary. Jesus was on that mountain.\nAnd what is meant when it says, and it became apparent to us from Mount Faran.'\nFaran is a mountain that is one day away from Mecca. As you and your friends said: the\nProphet Shaya has said in the Torah that I have seen the picture of the Rider of the\nDonkey. He was wearing gowns of light. And I have seen the Rider of the Camel, who is\nas bright as the moon.' Who is the Rider of the Donkey? Who is the Rider of the Camel?\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"I do not know who they are.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"The Rider of the Donkey is Jesus, and the Rider of the Camel is\nMuhammad (SA). Do you deny that this is from the Torah?\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"No, I do not deny that.\"\nThen al-Rida (AS) said: \"Do you know the Prophet Hayqua?\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"Yes, I know him.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said:\nHe said the following which your Book has also stated,\nAllah brought down the Bayan from Mount Faran. The heavens are filled with the\npraise of Ahmad and his nation. He will lead his troops at sea just as he carries them on\nland. He will bring us a new Book after the destruction of the Holy House (in\nJerusalem).'\nDid you know the, and do you believe in it?\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"In fact, the Prophet Hayquq has said this. I will not deny\nhis words.\nAl-Rida (AS) said:\nDavid said in his Psalms which you have also read, O my Allah! Appoint him who will\nestablish the practice after the cessation (of the prophets). Did you know of any\nprophet other than Muhammad (SA) who has established the practice after the end of\nthe period of prophecy?\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"this is what David said. We do not deny it. However, he\nwas referring to Jesus, as it was with him that the age of prophecy came to a close.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) told him,\nYou are wrong. In fact, Jesus endorsed the practices [sunah] of the Torah until Allah\nraised him up to Himself. It is written in the Bible.\nThe son of the pious woman will go, and the Paraclete will come after him. It is he who\nwill preserve the bonds, explain everything to you, and testify to my truth just as I\ntestified for him. I have brought you the examples, and he will bring you the\ninterpretations.\nDo you believe that this statement is in the Bible?\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"Yes.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) replied to him, \"O the Head of the Rabbis! I want to ask you about your\nProphet Moses.\"\nThe Jewish man said: \"He brought miracles which the prophets before him had not\nbrought.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked, \"Could you give me an example?\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis replied, \"He split the sea, turned the cane into a slithering\nserpent, made springs gush from stones, showed his hand white and shining to the\nonlookers, and other signs the like of which other creatures were unable to bring.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) replied to him, \"You are right. They are proofs of his Prophethood. He\nbrought the like of which other creatures were unable to brig. Is it obligatory on you to\nbelieve in whoever claims Prophethood, and performs something which all other\ncreatures are unable to perform?\"\nThe head of the Rabbis said: \"No, since there is no one like Moses considering his\nposition near his Lord and his closeness to Him. It is not incumbent upon us to profess\nthe Prophethood of whoever claims it, unless he brings us miracles similar to those\nbrought by Moses.\nThe Imam (AS) said:\nThen how come you admit the Prophethood of the other prophets who preceded Moses\nwho did not split the sea; nor did they make twelve springs gush forth from the stones,\nnor did they show a white shining hand as Moses did, nor did they turn the came into a\nslithering serpent.\nThe Jewish man replied:\nI told you that if they performed miracles as evidence for their Prophethood which all\nother creatures were unable to perform, and if they brought something the like of which\nMoses had brought, or they followed what Moses had brought, then it is incumbent\nupon us to believe in them.\nAl-Rida (AS) replied to him, \"O Head of the Rabbis! What has prevented you from\nprofessing (the Prophethood of) Jesus, the son of Mary? Jesus brought the dead to life,\nhealed the blind and the leprous, made birds formed of clay and breathed life into them\nwith Allah's permission.'\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"It is said that he did that but we did not see it.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"Have you seen the miracles performed by Moses? Have you not\nreceived the news by way of Moses's closest trustworthy companions who said he did\nthem?\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"Yes. That is so.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Well. The news about the miracles of Jesus, the son of Mary, have\nreached you in a similar fashion. Why then did you acknowledge Moses and believe in\nhim, but you did not believe in Jesus?\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis did not answer.\nAl-Rida (AS) said:\nThe same is true about Muhammad (SA) and his miracles. The same is true about any\nother prophet (AS) appointed by Allah. One of the miracles of Muhammad (SA) was that\nhe was a poor hired shepherd. He had not been taught anything. He did not have any\nteachers. However, the Qur'an which he brought contains the stories of the prophets\nand the associated news letter by letter. It has narrated news of the past, and the things\nto come in the future all the way up until the Day of Resurrection. The Qur'an provided\ninformation about what people did in hiding or in their homes. The Prophet brought\ninnumerable miracles.\nThe Head of the Rabbis said: \"Neither the account about Jesus nor that about\nMuhammad (SA) is considered correct by us. It is not permissible to admit their\nProphethood through what is not correct.\"\nAl-Rida (AS said: \"Has the witness who testified for Jesus (AS) and Muhammad (SA)\nthen given false testimony?\"\nThe Head of the Rabbis did not answer him.\n\nThen the Imam (AS) called the Zoroastrian High Priest. Al-Rida (AS) said to him, \"Let\nme know about Zoroaster who considered himself to be a prophet. What is your proof\nof his Prophethood?\"\nThe Zoroastrian High Priest said: \"He performed miracles which no one ever had\nperformed before him. Of course, I have not seen him, but the stories of our ancestors\ntell us that he made legitimate for us things which others had not made legitimate.\nTherefore, we follow him.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked, \"You believed in the stories which came to you about him, so\nyou followed him, did you not?\"\nHe replied, \"Yes.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said:\nThis is the case with all other nations. Stories came to them about what the prophets\nhad accomplished, and what Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (AS) had all brought to\nthem. So why did you not believe in any of these prophets, having believed in Zoroaster\nthrough the stories that came to you about him saying that he brought forth what\nothers did not?\nThe Zoroastrian High Priest froze in his place. Then al-Rida (AS) said: \"O people! If any\nof you is opposed to Islam, and wants to ask me any questions, then they should ask\nme and not be shy.\"\nImran the Sabian, who was an expert in theology, stood up and said:\nO Scholar of the people! I would not have asked you any questions if you had not\ninvited me to ask. I have been to Kufa, Basra, Syria, and Algeria. There I have met many\ntheologians. However, none of them have been able to establish for me the proof that\nthere is One who has no second other than Him, and that he is One Sole Being. Will you\npermit me to ask you this question?\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"If Imran the Sabian is present among the people here, it must be\nyou.\"\nHe said: \"Yes. It is I.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"O Imran! Ask, but I advise you to be fair. Avoid vain talk and\nnonsense.\"\nImran said: \"My Master! By Allah, I just want you to prove something which I can\nadhere to for me. Then I need not seek anything else.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Ask whatever you wish to ask.\"\nThe crowds moved closer to Imran and crowded in on him.\nImran the Sabian asked, \"let me know of the first thing and what it created.\"\nAl-Rida (AS) replied to him.\nYou asked. Now try to understand. As for the One. He has always been One Being. He\nhas no limits nor does He have transient qualities. He will always remain so. Then,\nwithout precedence, He created a different creature with transient qualities and various\ndifferent limits. He neither places it in anything, not did He limit it by anything. He\nneither created it like anything, nor did He create other things like it. He then created\nthe creatures in various shapes: pure and impure, different and alike, with various\ncolors, flavors and tastes. He did not create them out of a need for them, nor did He\ncreate them to attain a higher rank. He did not sense any increase or decrease in\nHimself due to this creation. O Imran! Do you understand this?\"\nImran said: \"By Allah, yes my Master!\"\nThe Imam (AS) added,\nO Imran! Know that if He had created what He created due to His need for them, then\nHe would have only created things by which He could fulfill His need. In that case, it\nwould have been better for Him to create several times more than what He created,\nsince the more the helpers there were, the more powerful their master would be.\nO Imran! In that case, His need would be a never-ending one. The more He would crate,\nthe more newer needs would appear for Him. That is why we say that He did not create\nthe creatures out of need. Through creation He transfers the needs of some of them to\nothers. And He makes some of them nobler than others without any need of the nobler\none or without wanting to take any revenge against those whom He had abased. That is\nhow He has created.\nImran asked, \"My Master! Was the Being known to Himself by His Own Self?\"\nAl-Rida (AS) said:\nKnowledge of something is required to distinguish it from other things, and to prove its\nexistence through what is negated about it. However, there was nothing else there to\noppose Him to make it necessary to negate. Since there was only Him, there was no\nneed to establish limits. O Imran Do you understand?\nImran said: \"Yes, by Allah, my Master! Then tell me: Through what means did He\ncome to know what He knew. Was it done by conscience or by something else?\"\nAl-Rida (",
