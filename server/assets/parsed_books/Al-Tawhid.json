The people were astonished by the beautiful words with which he praised Allah, Exalted be His Majesty. Abu Ishaq said: I asked Harith, \"Did you not memorize it?\" He answered, \"I wrote it down.\" So he dictated it to us from his script: All praise belongs to Allah for Who does not die, and Whose wonders shall never come to an end. He exercises His (Universal) Power everyday, creating things that did not exist before; Who does not beget any who could claim to share in His Glory and Might; and Who is not begotten to die so that He could leave an heir behind. He is beyond all imagination; hence, He cannot be regarded as a visible shape. He is too far beyond the reach of sight to leave any mental impression of Him. His Beginning has no beginning, and His End has no end. Time does not outlast Him. Excess and loss cannot affect Him. He cannot be described in terms of when, what and where. He is Hidden among the hidden. He is Manifest in the mind through His Signs, and through His Wisdom in His Creation. When questioned about Him, the prophets did not describe Him in terms of any limit, scope, extent or in terms of constituents. Rather, they described Him in terms of His Functions, and they led people towards Him through His Signs. The minds of the intellectuals do not dare deny His Existence. There can be no denying the Might of the Creator of the heavens and the Earth, and all that is between them. He is totally distinct from His Creation. Nothing resembles Him. He brought His Creation into existence so that He would be obeyed and worshipped. He gave human beings the strength to serve Him, and he rebutted their excuses through the best of arguments. Thus, whoever meets his doom does so knowingly and justifiably. It is through His Grace that redemption is secured by the redeemed, and it is Allah's Grace that prevails in this life and the life to come. Then, Allah to Whom all praise is due, inaugurated the function of this worldly life with His Own Praise, and wound up the function of this worldly life, and the next life, whit His Own Praise. As He Himself says: And judgment shall be given between them with justice, and it shall be said: All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. All praise is due to Allah Who, despite having no body, has adorned Himself with the Robes of Greatness and Grandeur, and has covered Himself with the Mantle of Awe and Reverence, without having any corporal form. He occupies the Celestial Throne unceasingly. He is far above His Creation, without being far, and without being in mutual contact with them. Neither has He any limit which may end in any limit, nor is there anything like Him through which He can be recognized. Whoever claims to be holy, except Him, is bound to be humiliated. Whoever magnifies himself is bound to be humbled. All thins bow before His Greatness and are obedient to His Lordship and Might. The function of the eyes becomes tired in searching for Him. The imagination is unable to reach His Attributes. He existed before any beginning, and nothing preceded Him. He is the Last of All, and there is no last for Him at all. With His Might He holds sway over all things. He observes all places without making any movement. No touch can ever touch Him nor can any sense ever sense Him. And He it is Who is Allah in Heavens and Allah in the Earth; and He is the Wise, the knowing.1 Whatever He intended to create He planned for it soundly and correctly without there being any example of it before, and without being tired thereby (in creating whatever He wanted to create). He started whatever He needed to start, and made whatever He wanted to make. He intended to create two weights, the jinn and humankind, so that they should recognize His Lordship on the basis of all these means (of revealed wisdom in His Creation referred to above), and be able to obey Him (consciously). We glorify Allah with all words of praise for the bounties He has bestowed. And we seek guidance from Him in our righteous affairs. Furthermore, we seek refuge from Him against our misdeeds. We solicit His Forgiveness for our past sins. We bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad (SA) in His Servant and Messenger whom Allah raised with truth, who leads to Allah, and who guides towards Him. Thus, He rescued us from misguidance through him, guiding us to the right path, and through him freed us from ignorance. Hence, whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, he indeed achieves a mighty success,2 and has secured divine blessings in abundance. And whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger surely suffers a manifest loss, and deserves a humbling chastisement. Hence, strive to listen, obey counsel with sincerity, and share the burden with others effectively and gracefully. Help yourself by sticking to the right path, and in avoiding wicked deeds. Give to others what is right, and take from others what is right. Cooperate with me (the Imam) by means of these tasks. Seize the idiotic oppressor, tie him, and bind him. Promote the good, and prohibit the evil. Learn to appreciate the worth of illustrious people. May Allah keep us secure and steady on the right path, and keep us constant in abstaining from evil! I beg Allah for our forgiveness! 1 2 Translator's Note: Quran: 43:84. Translator's Note: Quran: 33:71.",

  "Content": "2. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Muhammad ibn Amr al-Katib, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ziyad al-Qalzumi, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Abu Ziyad al-Jiddi, the one who lead the prayers at Jiddah, that Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Umar ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) related to me that I heard Abu al-Hasan al-Rida (AS) say this about the Unity (of Allah) in the presence of alMamum, Ibn Abu Ziyad said: their freed slave and maternal uncle to some of them, Ahmad ibn Abd Allah al- Alawi also related it to me, on the authority of al-Qasim ibn Ayyub al- Alawi that When al-Mamum wanted to appoint al-Rida (AS) to the Caliphate, he gathered the Hashimites and said: I want to appoint al-Rida as the Caliph after me.\" The Hashimites envied him because of this and said: \"Are you going to hand over political and religious authority to an ignorant man who has no idea of how to run the Caliphate? Have him summoned before us so that you can see his ignorance, and then you can judge what we affirm.\" Therefore, he sent someone to summon him. The Hashimites said to him (AS): \"O Abu al-Hasan! Go up to the pulpit, and give us an example of how we should serve Allah.\" Hence he (AS) climbed up the pulpit, sat down, and lowered his head for some time without saying anything. He (AS) then rose up, stood up straight, praised Allah and extolled Him, and sent blessings on the Prophet and his Household (AS). He (AS) then said: The best of service is to acknowledge the existence of Allah. The foundation of acknowledgement of Allah is to process His unity. Allah's Unity is established through the denial of descriptions, since all intellects bear witness that descriptions are created, and whatever is created requires a Creator, who is neither identifier or identified. Every identifier and identified is connected, and connection is evidence of occurrence. Whatever occurs cannot be eternal. Hence, anyone who describes Allah in anthropomorphic terms has not described Allah's Essence. Furthermore, anyone who describes Allah by means of reason has not described Him. Anyone who equates Him with anything has not described the Reality. Anyone who limits Allah has not recognized Him. Anyone who seeks to point Him out has not approached Him. Anyone who describes Allah in human terms has not described Him. Anyone who divides Allah into parts has not drawn near Him. And anyone who imagines Allah has intended other than Him. Everything which is known is in itself created. Every existence other than Him is caused. The existence of Allah is inferred through His Creation. The existence of Allah is acknowledged by means of the intellect. The existence of Allah is proven through nature. Allah placed the creation as a veil between the Creator and the created. Allah differs from creation by means of His Distinction. He gave a beginning to everything so that everything would know that He ha no beginning, and so that everything would know that those who have a beginning are incapable of giving a beginning to others. He gave movement to everything so that everything would know that He is devoid of movement, because movement is a manifestation of need. His Names are interpretations. His Actions are instructions. His Essence is a fact. The Core of His Essence is a distinction between Him and His Creation. And His Elapses [ghubur] are limitations for all but Him. Verily, whoever describes Allah is ignorant of Him. Anyone who attempts to encompass Him has totally missed Him. And anyone who thinks that He can be grasped in His Entirety has totally mistaken Him. Anyone who asks, \"How is He?\" has compared Him. Anyone who asks, \"Why does He exist?\" implies that He is caused. Anyone who asks, \"How long has He existed?\" has subjected Him to the limits of time. He who asks, \"In what is He?\" implies that He is contained. He who asks, \"What is His Extent?\" has limited Him. He who asks, \"How far does He reach?\" has raised Him, and whoever raises Him, implies that He has a limit. Whoever gives Allah an extent implies that He has parts. Whoever claims that Allah has parts has described Him. Whoever describes Him has disbelieved in Him. Allah is not subject to change like creation is subject to change. In the same way, He is not limited like the limitations of the limited. He is One, but not in the sense of a number. He is Apparent, but not in the sense of pursuit. He is Evident, but not in the sense of sight. He is Hidden, but not in the sense of pursuit. He is Far, but not in the sense of distance. He is Near, but not in the sense of closeness. He is Subtle, but not in the sense that He has a body. He is Existent, but not in the sense that He comes from non-existence. He is a Doer, but not by means of compulsion. He is the Appraiser, but not by means of thought. He is the Controller (of the Universe), buy not by means of movement. He is the One who Wills, but not by means of soliciting. He is the One who Wills, but not in the sense that He is eager. He is the Perceiver, but not by means of touch. He is All-Hearing, but not by means of any instrument. He is All-Seeing, but not by means of any tool. Time cannot be associated with Him. Space does not contain Him. Slumber does not seize Him. Attributes do not limit Him. Tools do not bind Him. His Essence supersedes time. His Existence supersedes non-existence. His Eternity supersedes beginning. By giving senses to other, He proves that He is devoid of sense. By creating substance, He proves that He is not a substance. By giving contrasts, He proves that He has no contrast. By establishing pairs in creation, He proves that He has not partner. Light is the opposite of darkness like certainty is the opposite of uncertainty. Dryness is the opposite of wetness as cold is the opposite of heat. By creating similarity, Allah points out that He is the Creator. By creating difference, Allah points out that He is the Differentiator. As the Might and High has said: And of everything We have created pairs that you may be mindful.1 Therefore, He differentiated between the prior and the subsequent to prove that nothing precedes Him, and that nothing succeeds Him. Everything that has an instinct bears witness that the One who gave them their instinct ha no instinct. Everything that is different bears witness that the One who made the different is devoid of differences. Everything that is subjected to time 1 Translator's Note: Quran: 51:49.",

  "Content": "3. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Muhammad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Kufi said; and (also) Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Zakariyya al-Qittan, on the authority of Bakr ibn Abd Allah ibn Habib, on the authority of Tamim ibn Buhlul, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu Muawiyah, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Abd al-Rahman, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu Abd Allah (AS) on the authority of his father, on the authority of his grandfather (AS) that The Commander of the Faithful (AS) roused the people to was with Muawiyah for the second time. When the people gathered around him, he stood up and addressed them in the following terms: All praise be to Allah, the One and Only who is sought by all, the Unique and the One Who was not created out of anything nor created anything out of pre-existing matter. On the contrary, He created everything through His Might which is manifest in all things. And verily, everything came into existence because of Him. He has no attribute which can be comprehended, nor has He any limit which can be established. In linguistic embellishment, the tongue is crippled when it comes to describing His Attributes. And circumlocution with respect to His Attributes leads to a blind alley. The sharpest of intellects are unable to comprehend His Kingdom. All comprehensive explanation is rendered ineffective in delving deep into His Kingdom. Unseen veils impede even the lowest level of understanding of His Hidden Knowledge. The keenest insights are at a loss when attempting to comprehend the most superficial layer of His Subtleties. Thus, hallowed be Allah who can neither be reached by the most intrepid intellect nor conceived by the deepest insight. Exalted be He who is not subject to time, length, or limit. Purified be He whose Beginning has not beginning, whose End has no end, and who will never be annihilated. Glorified be He! He is as He has described Himself, and the describers cannot reach His Descriptions. He delineated the boundaries of all things at the time of their creation, and completely eradicated the possibility of Him resembling things or of things resembling Him. He cannot be contained by things which could describe Him. He has never been separate from things that can describe Him. He has never bin distant from things which could raise questions as to His whereabouts. Rather, He, the Glorified, has encompassed all the things through His Knowledge, strengthened them, and enumerated them in His Memory. Nothing is hidden from Him behind the veils of the atmosphere, the deep slumber which occurs in darkness, and whatever exists in the highest Heavens, and the lowest Earth. Everything that exists has a custodian and a keeper. All things are surrounded by other things. And He encompasses them all. He is the One, the Unique, and the Besought. He is not subject to time. He does not tire from creating thins. Whatever He willed, He said: \"Be\" and it was. He created everything without precedent, without fatigue, and without planning. Anything which makes something makes it out of something. Allah, however, made His Creation out of nothing. Every scholar acquired knowledge after being ignorant while Allah was never ignorant, and never acquired knowledge. He encompassed all things through His Knowledge even before they were created. Hence, His Knowledge did not increase through their creation. After they came into existence, He knew as much about them as He knew before they came into existence. He never created anything to strengthen His Control. He never created anything out of fear of decay or loss. He never created anything to oppose an adversary. He never created anything to match an equal. He never created anything to become the equal of a dominating partner. He never did anything of the like because all of creation is nurtured by Him, and all things that exist are His Humble Slaves and Servants. Glorified be He who never feels weary from creating, and sustaining. And glorified be He who was not prevented from creating more out of inability or laziness. He knew what He created, and created what He knew. Whatever He created was not the result of deliberation or based on new knowledge. Nor does any doubt arise in Him regarding the things He has not created. What He created, and what He did not create, was the result of His Inviolable Decision. His Firm Knowledge, and His Exact Command. He made Himself Unique in His Lordship, and Specific in (His) Oneness. He earmarked glory and praise for Himself, made Himself Peerless in Unity, Grandeur and Sublimity. He remains Matchless in Praise, and Exalted in His Glory. He is far above parenthood. And he is purified and sanctified against the feminine touch (i.e. sexual relations). He is far too Great and too Mighty to seek the proximity of any participant. Thus, nothing He has created can oppose Him. There is no equal to Him in His Possessions, and there is no partner for Him in His Kingdom. He is the One, the Unique, and the Besought of all. He is the Eternal, the Everlasting, and the Lord of Space. He has always been, and always will be. He is Unique in Eternity. He existed before time and will exist after the end of all affairs. He will never come to an end nor be exhausted. This is how I describe my Lord. Thus, there is no god but Allah. He is the Greatest of the Great. Glorified and Exalted be He. He is the Mightiest of the Mighty. He is far, far, above what the unjust claim about Him. And Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Saqar al-Saigh also said this sermon that Muhammad ibn al-Abbas ibn Bassam said: Abu Zayd Said ibn Muhammad al-Basri related to me that Umrah bint Aws related to me that My grandfather al-Husayn ibn Abd al-Rahman related to me on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu Ad Allah Ja''far ibn Muhammad (AS), on the authority of his father on the authority of his grandfather (AS) that the Commander of the Faithful (AS) addressed this sermon when he roused the people to the war with Muawiyah for the second time.",

He is the Great Absolute with Grandeur and Might. He innovated what He instigated. And He originated what He created without example prior to creating anything. The One without a Beginning raised us through the benevolence of His Lordship. With His knowledge He rendered. Due to the judgment of His Omnipotence He created all of creation. With the light of morning He made the dawn. Therefore, there is no substitute for His Creation, and none can modify what He makes. There is no hastening his Judgement, and no resting from His Call. There is no decline to His Realm, not an interruption to His Time. He is the First Existence, and is Forever Permanent. He is covered by His light, not by His Creation, in the high-aspiring horizon, the lofty might, and the high realm. He is far from everything, yet He is close to everything. Hence, He is Evident to His creation without being seen. He is the Highest Prospect. He liked to be qualified with Oneness so He covered Himself with His own Light. He is Distinctive in His Sublimity, and is Hidden from His Creation. He sent Messengers to His Creation as His Decisive Argument and Witnesses over them. Between the Messengers, He sent Prophets to His Creation, to give glad tidings (to the believers) who would be granted eternal life after having received the Evidence from Allah. He also sent Prophets to His Creation as warners of impeding doom to those who would be destroyed after having received the Evidence (from Allah). He did all of this so that servants may know their Lord. As a result, they recognized His Lordship after having denied it. They professed the Unity of His Divinity as a result of Diving Guidance.",

He cannot be described with variation so that He may have an extent. He can neither be perceived by intellects and imaginations, nor by thoughts and concepts. Reason and intellect cannot describe Him by means of the questions: when,' from what did He begin,' on what' does He reveal or in what' does He conceal?

Then he stood up, with his\nface flushed, and addressed the congregation as such:\nAll praise be to Allah for Whom refusal to give does not enrich, and for Whom\nmunificence does not make poor! All who give lose, expect He. He is full of\nbeneficial bounties and plentiful gifts. All of creation depends on His Generosity for\ntheir sustenance. He has prepared the way for those who seek Him. He is as\nGenerous when He is asked, as He is when He is not asked. Time does not affect\nHim as this would imply that He is subject to change.\nHis Essence would not be affected, and His Wealth would not be diminished, even if\nHe gave away all of the silver and all of the gold found in the mines in the\nmountains, and all of the pearls which the shells of the ocean produce for His\nServants. His Wealth would remain great and unaffected, even if He answered the\ndemands of every beggar because He is the Most Generous. Giving does not\ndecrease His Wealth, not do the request of His Supplicants make Him miserly. His\nCommand, when He intends anything, is only to say to it: Be, so it is.\nThe Angels are incapable of approaching the nobility of His Throne. They are\nconfused when they attempt to understand Him and the greatness of His Might and\nMajesty. Although they are close to His Realm, they know nothing about His Affair\nexcept what He informs them. They are so close to the sanctity of His Realm, that\nthey recognize the limitations with which they were created saying: Glory be to\nThee! We have no knowledge but that which Thou hast taught us; surely Thou art\nthe Knowing, the Wise.\nThen what is your opinion, O questioner, about the One I have described in such\nterms? Praise and glory be to Him. He has no beginning, and is not subject to\nchange. His Essence does not change states. Long stretches of day and night have\nno affect on Him. He originated the creation without any example which He could\nfollow, and without any specimen prepared by any deity that was before Him.\nAttributes do no encompass Him so that we can comprehend Him, much less\ncomprehend Him by means of limitations. He is Still. There is nothing whatsoever\nlike unto Him. Exalted is He from the attributes of the created. Eyes cannot perceive\nHim so that He may be described by sight. His Essence is only known to Himself\nand cannot be recognized by His Creation. His Greatness surpasses the greatest\nconjectures of the most imaginative. He is Higher than anything that could be\nconceived by the feeble minds who seek to understand His Inner Greatness.\nHe does not have a likeness. Nothing He creates is similar to Him. To the ones that\nrecognize Him, He is above compeers and opponents. The ones who give partners\nto Allah are liars as they compare Him to their own kind. They embellish Him\nthrough their imaginations with the ornaments of creation. They divided Him in parts\nthrough speculation. They use their intellects to assess Him on the basis of\ncreation, giving Him different strengths. How can this be done when it is impossible\nfor the intellect to measure His Extent?\nMisleading dreams have gone astray in perceiving His Essence; because He is\nhigher than the limits of human reasoning. Even the Angels, who are close to His\nRealm of Glory, cannot encompass Him. Exalted is He from having a parallel with\nwhich He may be resembled.\nHe is the Subtle [al-Latif]. He prevents the imagination from finding Him in the depth\nof His Realm. He prevents the minds which are free from evil thoughts from\ncomprehending His Being. He prevents the hearts who long to embrace His\nAttributes from going beyond description, and securing knowledge of His Divinity.\nHe turns back those who cross the dark pitfalls of the unknown in their search for\nHim. Glorified be He!\nAll those who seek to comprehend him return defeated, admitting that His\nKnowledge cannot be understood through such random efforts. They admit that not\nan iota of His Honor can enter the intellect of the greatest thinkers. They admit that\nHe is far from the most powerful strengths of limited beings because He is other\nthan His Creation. Therefore, He has no peer in His Creation. Verily, things are\ncompared to their equal. However, if something has no equal, how can it be\ncompared with something which is completely different from it?\nHe is the Originator who had nothing before Him, and He is the Last who has\nnothing after Him. Eyes cannot perceive Him due to the magnificence of His Power.\nEyes are concealed with veils, and cannot penetrate their density. Eyes cannot\npenetrate the Veils of the Possessor of the Throne, and they cannot reach the One\nwho Governs Everything through His Will. The pride of all tyrants cringes except the\nMajesty of His Greatness. All slaves surrender to Him, and all faces fear His Wrath.\nThe signs of His Wisdom are apparent from everything He has created. Everything\nHe created is His Proof, and is linked to Him. It is a silent creation, it is His Proof that\nspeaks through planning. He has fixed limits for everything He has created and has\nset everything firm. He has put everything in its place through the gracefulness of\nHis Planning.\nHe has fixed the direction for everything. Nothing surpasses or falls shorts of the\nposition He has willed. Nothing disobeys His Command to move, when He intends\nit to move. He does so without effort, and without challenge to His Order. Thus was\ncompleted the creation, and it bowed in obedience to Him. It was time for His\ncreation to respond to Him. The laziness of any slug or the inertness of any excusefinder\ndid not prevent them from doing so.\nSo He straightened the curves of things, and completed the traces of their limits.\nWith His Power He created coherence n their contradictory parts, and joined\ntogether the factors of similarity. Then He distinguished their colors, and separated\nthem in varieties which differ in quantities, properties, and shapes. All of this was a\nnew creation. He made them firm, shaped them as He intended, and invented them.\nThrough His Knowledge He organized everything into species. His Planning\nperceives the splendor of its destiny.\nO questioner! Know that he who describes our Sublime Lord by means of limbs and\nextremities knows nothing about His Nature. Verily, his heart did not profess with\ncertainty that He is devoid of partners. It is as though he has not heard people\nrenouncing their false gods by saying: By Allah! We were certainly in manifest error,\nwhen we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds. \nWhoever equates our Lord with anything has given Him a partner. Whoever gives\nHim a partner is an unbeliever as is stated in His Unambiguous verses, and as is\nindicated by His Clear Arguments. This is because Allah cannot be conceived by the\nlimits of human intelligence. If He could be, He would be subject to change. Nor can\nAllah be conceived by means of intellectual efforts. If He could be, he would be\nlimited, and an object subject t alteration.\nHe is the Producer [al-Munshi'] who created everything without a need for\nimagination, without the urge of a hidden impulse, without any past experiment, and\nwithout the assistance of any partner who may have helped Him in creating\nwonderful things.\nThose who compare Him to His Creation divided Him into parts: some are limited,\nsome vary in size, and others fall into different categories. He, the Mighty and High,\nExists on His Own Accord, and is not dependent. People have not honored Him with\nthe honor that He deserves.\nIn order to demonstrate that He cannot be compared to His Creation, that He has no\nequals, and that He is far above the analogies of the unbelievers who give him\nlimitations, He said: Any they have not honored Allah with the honor that is due to\nHim; and the whole Earth shall be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and\nheavens rolled up in His right hand; glory be to Him, and may He be exalted above\nwhat they associate (with Him).\nWhen describing Allah, limit your selves to the Divine Attributes which the Quran\nhas provided, and seek light from the effulgence of its guidance. Leave to Allah that\nknowledge which Satan has prompted you to seek, and which neither the Quran\nenjoins you to seek, nor is there any trace of it in the actions or sayings of the\nProphet and other Imams of Guidance. This is the extreme limit of Allah's claim\nupon you.\nKnow that those who are firm in knowledge refrain from opening through the veils of\nthe unseen. The firm in knowledge, acknowledge their ignorance, and refuse to seek\njustification for their belief by means of the unseen. Hence, they say: We believe in\nit, it is all from our Lord. Allah, the Mighty and High praises them for admitting that\nthey cannot obtain forbidden knowledge. They do not engage in deep discussions\nregarding the knowledge which is hidden from them and remain firm in their faith.\nBe content with this, and do not limit the Greatness of Allah on the basis of the\nlimits of your own intelligence; otherwise, you will be destroyed.",

Therefore, he\nreplied to me in his own writing.\nJafar says: Verily, Fath took out the letter for me so I read it myself in Abu al-Hasan's\n(AS) writing:\nIn the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. All praise be to Allah,\nwho gave human beings a natural predisposition to recognize their Lord and to praise\nHim. Allah guides humankind towards Himself through His Creation, and who proves\nthat He is Eternal by bringing creatures into existence. He has made them resemble\neach other to prove that there is nothing that resembles Him. He has made His Signs as\nwitnesses to His Might.\nHis Essence is independent from His Attributes. Eyes are prevented from seeing Him.\nImagination is incapable of encompassing Him. There is no duration for His Being, nor\nis there any limit for His Continuation. Human senses do not encompass Him.\nNo screen (of non-understandability) can conceive Him. The only screen between the\nCreator and the created is creation itself. The reason why the created have been\nscreened from the Creator is to prevent the created from conceiving of their Creator in\nterms which are unworthy. This is because the adjectives which apply to the created\nare not suitable for the Creator.\nThe other reason (that Allah cannot be understood) is that there is a world of difference\nbetween the Creator and the created, the Sustainer and the sustained (the Ruler and the\nruled), and the Confiner and the confined. He is One, but not in a numerical sense. He is\nthe Creator, but not in the sense of movement or action. He is the All-Hearing, but not\nthrough any auditory organ. And He is the All-Seeing, but not by visual means.\nHe is a Witness, but without mutual contact. He is Manifest, but not in the sense of\nbeing distant. He is Hidden, but not in the sense of being behind a curtain. He is\nApparent, but not in the sense of being in front of anything. Penetrating eyes have\ncalled miserable trying to perceive the truth about Him. His Existence dwarfs and\ncripples the imagination (in its attempt to grasp Him).\nThe first step in accepting faith is acknowledging the existence of Allah. And the most\nperfect way of acknowledging Him lies in recognizing His Unity. And the peak of His\nUnity lies in negating that His Attributes are part of His Essence, since attributes are\nseparate from the entity they describe in the same way that the entity is independent of\nand separate from the attributes which describe it. If united, the entity and its attributes\nproduce plurality (as opposed to unity).\nPlurality nullifies eternity. Hence, whoever ascribes attributes to Allah has actually\nmeasure Him. And whoever measures Him has actually nullified His Eternity. Whoever\nasks how He is, seeks to describe and explain Him. Whoever asks what He is, actually\ninduces Him. Whoever asks where He is, actually vacates Him (from other places).\nWhoever asks how long He will exist, actually confines Him (to a limited time). He was\nthe Knower before there was anything to know. He was the Creator when there was no\ncreation. He was the Lord when there was nothing over which to rule. He was the One\nGod when there was nothing to serve. Such is a description of our Lord. And He is far\nabove what the narrators have said about Him.",

I\nheard him say that \"Whoever fears Allah is feared, and whoever obeys Allah is\nobeyed.\" So I politely went over to him and greeted him. Hence, he (AS) returned my\ngreetings and then added:\nO Fath, he who pleases the Creator does not consider the displeasure of the\ncreation. And he who displeases the Creator deserves that that displeasure of\ncreation overpowers him. Verily, the Creator can only be described by means of the\nattributes He has given Himself.\nAnd how could He be described when he made the senses incapable of conceiving\nHim, the concepts incapable of describing Him, and the eyes incapable of perceiving\nHim? He is far above the attributes of the attributers and the descriptions of the\ndescribers. He is distant in His Closeness and close in His Distance. Thus, He is\nnear in His Farness and Far in His Nearness.\nSince He created conditions, the question how' cannot apply to Him. He ionized\nspace; therefore, the question where' cannot apply to Him. IN doing so He is the\nInventor [Mubdi'] of conditions and space. O Fath! Everybody is nourished with\nfood except the Creator, the Sustainer. Verily, He created bodies, yet He has neither\nbody nor image. He does not have parts, not does He have an end. He does not\nincrease or decrease.\nHe is not composed of any substance that would be found in a body. He is the\nSubtle, the All-Knowing, the All-Listening, and the All-Hearing. He is the One, the\nUnique, and the Needless. He begets not, nor is He begotten, and there is nothing\nequal unto Him. He is the Producer of All things. He gave shape to all bodies and\nmade all images. IF it were as the anthropomorphist say, then the Creator could not\nbe distinguished from the created, the Sustainer from the sustained, or the\nOriginator from the originated. However, He is the Producer. He differs from created\nbodies, images and things in that He resembles nothing.\nI asked: \"if Allah is One and humankind is one, do they not resemble each other in\noneness?\"\nHence, he (AS) replied:\nYou have said something impossible. May Allah secure you! Verily, the resemblance\nis limited to meaning. Names are one, and they indicate what is named. When it is\nsaid that the human being is one, it means that he is one as opposed to two. But, in\nfact, the human being is not truly one because his body parts are different and his\ncolors are different. He is composed of many parts which are not the same. His\nblood is other than his flesh. His flesh is other than his blood. His nerves are other\nthan his veins. His hair is other than his skin. His darkness is other than his\npaleness. Likewise is the rest of creation. Thus, the human being in only \"one\" in\nname but not \"one\" in meaning.\nAllah, Exalted be His Majesty, is One and there is none other than Him. There is no\nvariation, contrast, increase, or decrease in Him. As for the human being, he is\ncreated from different parts and different substances. He is only \"one\" in\ncombination.\nI enquired: As for your statement regarding \"the Subtle,\" kindly explain it to me, I\nknow, of course, that His Subtlety differs from that of others. However, I would\nappreciate it if you could explain it to me in greater detail.\nTherefore, he (AS) answered:\nO Fath! I said: He is Subtle in subtleness of His Creation and in His Knowledge of\nmicroscopic matter. Do you not see His Stamp on the various types of plants, both\nsoft and rough? And do you not contemplate the subtle creation of creatures like the\ngnat and the mosquito and those insects which are even smaller than these two and\nare almost invisible to the naked eye? In fact, they are almost invisible due to their\ntiny size, making it virtually impossible to differentiate the male from the female, and\nthe young from the old.\nThus, when we see the smallness of creatures in their refinement, their instinct to\nreproduce, and their fear of death; when we see the creatures that exist in the\ndepths of the oceans, and in the branches of trees; when we see what exists in\ndeserts and wastelands, and that each species has a means of communication\nthrough which they are understood by their offspring; when we see how creatures\nfeed their offspring, and how creatures are distinguished by color, red with yellow,

The coming into\nbeing of beings bear witness that He is without a beginning. And the death of beings\nbear witness that He is Everlasting.\nThus, there is no refuge for them from His Reach; there is no fleeing His Encirclement;\nthere is no hiding from His Decree; and there is no avoiding His Omnipotence. The\ncomposition of nature is proof. Creation out of nothing is proof that He has no\nbeginning. The creative power is sufficient as an admonition. Thus, there is no limit\nconnected to Him, no likeness of Him, and there is nothing hidden from Him. Exalted is\nHe, the Most High, from the attributes of created things!\nI bear witness that there is no god but Allah, with faith in His Lordship, and in contrast\nto those who deny Him. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His\nMessenger, the Inhabitant of the Best Resting Place, the Fruit of the Most Noble Lions\nand Purified Wombs, the Product of the Most Dignified Lineage and Best Birth place\nwhich is inaccessible to others and which has the most honorable foundation.\nHe was chosen by Allah as His trustworthy Friend from the Tree of Prophethood. The\ntree possesses fine wood, an upright trunk, high branches, blooming twigs, ripened\nfruits, and a precious interior. In nobility was the tree planted, and in sanctity it grew,\nbranching off, and producing honorable fruits. Hence, the tree was given prestige, and\nwas made lofty by the Prophet Muhammad (SA).\nEventually, Allah, the Mighty and High, honored him with the Trusted Spirit [al-Ruh alAmin], the Open Light [al-Nur al-Mubin], and the Evident Book [al-Kitab al-Mustabin]. He\nmade Alboarak [buraq] subservient to Muhammad (SA) and the Angels greeted him.\nThe devils were frightened of him. Through him, Allah destroyed the idols, and the gods\nthat were served other than Him.\nHis practice [Sunnah] is sensible, his conduct [sirah] is just, and his judgment is true.

We extol Him with the praise that He approved for\nHis creation, and made mandatory upon Himself to accept it.\nI bear witness that there is no god but Allah, Alone, without associates, and I bear\nwitness that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger. The two witnesses elevate\nthe statement, and multiply the deeds. The scale of actions becomes lighter when these\ntwo witnesses are removed form it, and it becomes heavier when these two are places\nin it. With these two is the achievement of Paradise, escape from Hell, and crossing of\nthe Bridge (al-Sirat). With the two witnesses people may enter Paradise, and with\nsending blessings [salawat] people attain mercy.

    "Content": "3. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Ishaq al-Taliqani (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Said ibn Yahya\nal-Buzuri said: Ibrahim ibn al-Haytham al-Baladi said: My father said on the authority of alMuafi ibn Imran, on the authority of Israil, on the authority of al-Miqdad ibn Shurayh ibn\nHani', on the authority of his father that\n\n1\n\nOn the Day of Battle of Jamal, a Bedouin stood before the Commander of the Faithful\n(AS), and asked, \"O Commander of the Faithful! Do you say that Allah is One?\"\nHe says: the people attacked him saying that \"O Bedouin! Do you not see the state of\nmind of the Commander of the Faithful?\"\nSo the Commander of the Faithful (AS) said: \"Leave him alone. Verily, what this\nBedouin seeks to know is what we are seeking to establish by fighting these people.\"\nHe (the Commander of the Faithful) then said:\nO Bedouin! The statement that Allah is One' is of four types: Two types cannot be\napplied to Allah, the Mighty and High; while the two other types can be applied to Him.\nAs for the two types of statements that cannot be applied to Him, the first is the claim\nthat Allah is One in a numerical sense. Such a statement cannot be applied to Allah,\nbecause as the One, He has no second, and He is not subject to mathematic\ncalculation. Do you not see that he who claims that Allah is the third of the three has\ndisbelieved (in Him)?\nThe second statement which cannot be applied to Allah is the claim that He is One with\nhumankind. Since He derives the species from the genus, He cannot be described\nthrough anthropomorphism [tashbih]. Our Lord is Higher and more Exalted than this.\nAs for the two types of statements that can be applied to Allah, the first would be to say\nthat He is the One who resembles none. The second statement which can apply to Allah\nis the statement that He, the Mighty and High, is Alone, in the sense that He is\nIndivisible in Existence [wujud], Intellect [aql], and Thought [wahm]. That is another\ndignified description of our Lord, he Mighty and High.\nThe Compiler of this book says: I have heard the following from a person I trust due to the fact\nthat he is religious and due to his mastery of both Classical and colloquial Arabic:\nVerily, the words one, two three, and so forth, were developed in order to express quantity,\nand not to express quality. They have no meaning outside of counting, and determining units\nof measure in the tens, hundreds, and thousands.\nLikewise, when someone intends to inform another person about the exact quantity of a thing,\nhe names it by its specific name, and applies the number one' to it, describing its quantity, as\nopposed to its attributes. This is why one says: one pound [dirham], and one intends only a\npound, while it could be a pound in weight or a pound in number. So, if the persons want to\nconvey the meaning of weight, he would say: one pound in weight, but if he wants to convey\nthe meaning of number, he says; one pound in number.\nOn the basis, if a person says \"one man,\" the man can be one in the sense that he is one\nhuman being, as opposed to two. Or, he could be unique in merits, unique in knowledge,\nunique in generosity or unique in bravery. Thus, if a person intends to convey the sense of\nquantity, he says: \"one man;\" in the sense that he is one man as opposed to two men.\nHowever, if he intends to describe someone's excellence, he says: he is one of a kind (there is\nno one' like him). This indicates that nobody compares to him. If he wanted to stress the\nknowledge of a person, he would say: he is unique in knowledge. Hence, since the word one'\ncan indicate excellence, as well as quantity, it means that whoever called him one' under\nthese circumstances meant that there he had no second. In other words, there was no scholar\nlike him, and no person like him in quality. \nWhen this is not the case, then it is correct to say that one' merely indicates quantity.\nOtherwise, there, would be no sense in saying one of a kind' or limiting the meaning of\nknowledge or bravery. It has been established that when a person uses the word \"one\" on its\nown, it indicates quantity. However, depending on the context, it can also mean \"one\" or\n\"unique\" in knowledge, excellence, and generosity.\nAs we have already explained, one' pound [dirham] can be one pound in weight, one pound\nin number or count. It can also be two pounds in weight, and one pound in number or count.\nSometimes it is six dawaniq,1 and sixty fulus,2 and has many fractions. Likewise, a slave can\nbe one salve, and not two slaves; a person can be one person, and not two people, when in\nreality they are composed of many parts which are composed of many more parts.\nIn this sense, the slave cannot be one.' Verily, the slave is not one or unique [wahid], because\nevery slave has someone who is similar to him. It makes perfect sense for a slave to have\nsomeone who is the same as him in attributes and qualities. Hence it is necessary that Allah, the Mighty and High, be Unique in His Attributes and Most Beautiful Names. This is what\nmakes Him truly One God, who has no likeness; the One, who has no associates; and there is\nno god but He.\nTherefore, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is the One, the Eternal3 [qadim], and there is no\ngod but He. He is Unique, none is eternal but He, the Existing, who does not change, and is\nnot subject to change. He is the One beyond compare. Nothing is similar to Him. Nothing\nresembles Him. And nothing is like Him. Thus, He is an Indivisible Being in both Essence and\nImagination, a Think unlike other Things, and the One and Only True God. There is no god but\n\nIn conclusion, in Islamic Law, the titles the One [Wahid], and the Unique [Ahad], apply\nspecifically to Him, and are excluded from others. None but Allah, the Mighty and High, can\nbear these titles. And, as we have already explained, Allah is a name which can only applied\nto Him.\nIn addition to these examples, a thing can sometimes be counted with something which is\nsimilar to it. It is said: this is a man, these are two men, and these are three men; this is a\nslave, this is black, these are two slaves, these two are black. Therefore, it is not permissible\nto say: these are two gods as there is no god but the One God. Thus, Allah cannot be counted\nin this manner, nor does He enter numbers in this form in any way.\nSometimes a thing is counted with something different to it. Hence, it is said: this is the color\nwhite, these are white and black colors; this is a recent one [muhdath], these are two recent\nones; these are not two ones, and these are not two creatures; One of them is Eternal, and\nthe other is recent; one of them is the Lord, and the other is the servant.",

    "Content": "So, on this basis, it is acceptable to apply numbers to Him as Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has\nsaid: Nowhere is there a secret counsel between three persons but He is the Fourth of them, not\n(between) five but He is the Sixth of them, nor less than that nor more but He is with them\nwheresoever they are.1 Similarly, the statement Verily', he is one man' does not merely\nstress his excellence. Likewise, our statement, so and so in number two to so and so,' does\nnot simply indicate that he exist. It only does so when it is specified that he is second to him in\nexcellence, in perfection, or in knowledge.'\nAs for the Unity of Allah, Exalted is His Remembrance, it refers to the Unity between His\nExalted Attribute, and His Most Beautiful Names. He is One, without associates, and without\nsimilarity. He who affirms this about the Mighty and High on the basis of His Exalted Attribute\nand Most Beautiful Names with conviction is a true monotheist. Hence, the one who fails to\nrecognize Allah, the Mighty and High, through his Exalted Attributes, and Most Beautiful\nNames, does not affirm His Oneness, and is not a true monotheist.\nSometimes the ignorant people say: Verily, a monotheist is one who professes the Oneness of\nAllah even if He does profess the Unity of His Attributes. The ignorant people are told: You\nhave rejected Divine Unity. Whoever claims that His Lord is One God, and One Being, and\nthen applies His Attributes to other than Him, is an idolater, an anthropomorphist, and a nonMuslim according to the consensus of every school of thought in the Ummah. Such is the\ncase, even if he claims that His Lord id One God, One Thing and One Being.\nAccepting Divine Unity, while failing to accept the Divine Attributes, is like saying Allah is\nseparate from His Attributes whereas Divine Unity is the Unity between Allah and His\nAttributes. I is impossible for another god to exist. Allah is One God without partners, and\nwithout similarity. If He was not United with His Attributes, then he would have an associate or\nsomething similar to Him. Likewise, if a servant did not embody him own attributes, another\nservant would have to exist. As a result, he would not be one servant, but two servants.\nHence, anyone who professes that Allah is One with His Attributes is a true monotheist, and a\nBeliever in Divine Unity.\nAllah, the Mighty and High, unites every attribute which is applicable exclusively to Him. These\nattributes include the Existent since it cannot be conceive that He can dissolve into something\nor that something can dissolve into Him. Nor is it conceivable that His Existence can come to\nan end, that He can be destroyed, or that He can suffer any type of decline. He is the First of\nthe First, the Last of the Last, and the Omnipotent.\nHe is not subject to weakness or inability. He is the Most Powerful of the Powerful, and the\nSubduer [qahir] of all Subduers. He is Omniscient: nothing is hidden from Him, and nothing\nescapes Him. He is the Most Learned of the Learned. Ignorance, mistakes, errors, doubts,\nand forgetfulness cannot be attributed to Him. He is the Ever-Living. He is not subject to\nsleep or death. Nothing benefits Him nor can anything harm Him. He is the One who Remains, the\nMost Complete of the Complete, and the Doer who is never occupied. Nothing incapacitates\nHim nor does He miss anything. He is the Lord of the First and Last, the Best of Creators, and\nthe Foremost of those who take account.\nHe is the Wealthy One [ghani], devoid of nothing. He is the Self-Sufficient [mustaghni], devoid\nof need. He is the Just, devoid of criticism and defects. He is the Wise One, devoid of\nfoolishness. He is the Most Merciful, whose Mercy cannot be increased kindness.2 He is the\nForbearing [halim], devoid of emotion and haste. He is the Most Just of the Just, the Best of\nJudges, and the Foremost of those who take Account. This is because the first of the First\ncannot be but One. He is the Omnipotent, the Most Learned, the Best of Judges, the Best of\n\nCreators, and all such descriptions are correct.1 Favor is from Allah, as is protection and\nguidance.",

There is no one but He!\"\nWhen I got up in the morning I related this to the Messenger of Allah (SA), so he (SA) said to me: O Ali, you have been taught the greatest name (al-ism al-azam].\"\nHence, it was on my tongue on the day of the battle of Badr.\nThe Commander of the Faithful (AS) read \"The Chapter of Divine Unity,\" and when he\nfinished he said: \"O He! O One! There is no one but He! Forgive me, and help me\nagainst the unbelievers.\"\nAli (AS) used to say this in the Battle of Siffin while he was giving chase (to the\nenemies), so Ammar ibn Yasir asked him: \"O Commander of the Faithful! What is the\nmeaning of this expression?\"\nHe (AS) answered: \"It is the greatest name of Allah. It is the main pillar of Divine Unity: there is not god but He.\"\nThen he (AS) read: Allah bears witness that there is no god but He, and (so do) the\nAngels and those possessed of knowledge, maintaining His Creation with justice; there\nis no god but He, the Mighty and the Wise,1 and the last verse of the chapter \"The\nBanishment\" [al-Hashr].\nThen he dismounted (his horse) and prayed four units [rakat] of prayer before\nnoon[zawwal].\nAl-Baqir (AS) said: The Commander of the Faithful (AS) said: \"The meaning of Allah is\nthe One who is worshipped' and the One who taken and served as God.' Allah is\nHidden from the grasp of vision, and concealed from both imagination and thought.\nAl-Baqir (AS) said: The meaning of Allah is the One who is worshiped.' Creation cannot\ngrasp His Essence or understand His Nature. The Arabs say \"he is overwhelmed' when\nsomeone is amzed with something which his knowledge does not comprehend. And\nthey also say \"he is confused\" when someone is frightened of something. Therefore, God [ilah] is hidden from the sensory perception of the created.\nAl-Baqir (AS) said: The Alone [Ahad], the Peerless [Fard], the Unique. The One [Wahid],\nand the Alone [Ahad] have the same meaning that the Unique who has no like. Divine\nUnity is the affirmation of the Absolute Unity of Allah. For this reason they say: The first\nof numbers is one, but the One is not a number because numbers do not apply to Him.\nAs they only apply to two and above.

Now to our topic: Do\nnot argue about the Quran, do not dispute over it, and do not speak about it without\nknowledge.

    "Content": "6. Wahab ibn Wahab al-Qurashi related\nI heard al-Sadiq (AS) saying that a delegation from Palestine came to al-Baqir (AS) and\nenquired about issues so he answered them. Then they asked him about the Needless [alSamad]; hence, he said:\n\nThe meaning of the Needless [al-Samad] is found in the five letters of the word itself:\nAlif means to ascertain His Essence [inniyyat], as in the Word of the Mighty and High: Allah bears witness that there is no god but He,1 which means that he is not subject to\nsensory perception. The lam stands for divinity [ilahiyyah] and means that He, and only\nHe, is Allah. The Alif and Lam are not pronounced by the tongue, and are not heard in\nlistening; however, they appear in writing, demonstrating that His Divinity is a Secret of\nHis Benevolence. The senses do not perceive them. They are not perceived in the\nwords of the speaker, and they are not heard by ears of the listener.\nThis is because the meaning of the word God [ilah] is: the One whose Essence and\nNature cannot be perceived by the imagination or the senses. On the contrary, their\n[alif, lam] appearance in writing is an indication that Allah, Glory be to Him, manifested\nHis Lordship through the creation of subtle spirits and unsubtle bodies. When a servant\nlooks at himself, he does not see his spirit in the same way that the lam does not\nbecome evident, and is not perceived y any of the five sense. However, when he looks\nat the written form, what is hidden and elegant becomes evident to him. Thus,\nwhenever a servant ponders the Essence of the Maker [al-bari'] and His Nature, he is\noverwhelmed and amazed, as his thoughts cannot grasp the concept of God, because\nHe, the Mighty and High, is the Creator of Concepts. When he looks at the creation, however, he is forced to acknowledge that the Mighty and High is the creator and\nComposer of both spirits and bodies.\nAs for the sad, it symbolizes that He, the Mighty and High, is al-Sadiq, the Truthful. His\nWords are the Truth. His Speech is the Truth. He calls upon His Servants to follow the\ntruth, and He has promised in truth the place of Truth. The mim symbolizes His\nKingdom [mulk], and that He is the Righteous King who surrenders not, and whose\nKingdom never declines.\nAnd the dal symbolizes the eternity [dawam] of His Kingdom and that He, the Mighty\nand High, is Eternal. Exalted be He, the Mighty and High, from being created or from\ndeclining. He originated the Universe, and created all beings.\nHe (AS) then added,\nIf I had found a bearer for my knowledge, bestowed upon me by Allah, the Mighty and\nHigh, I would have certainly spread Divine Unity, Islam, Faith, Religion, and Islamic law\non the basis of the word the Needless' [al-Samad]. And how could it be possible for me\nto find someone to carry my knowl3edge, when even my grandfather, the Commander\nof the Faithful (AS) did not find any bearer for his knowledge, causing him to sigh\ndeeply, and proclaim the following from the pulpit: Ask me before you lose me, for\nverily I am full of knowledge. Alas I cannot find any hone who can bear it. Beware! I am\nthe Proof of Allah upon you. Hence, do not support the people with whom Allah is\nangry. Do not support people who have no hope in the Hereafter just like the\nunbelievers are hopeless like the dead. Then al-Baqir (AS) added:\nPraise be to Allah who granted us favor, and success in serving Him, the Unique, on\nwho all depend, who begets not, nor is He begotten, and none is like Him. He kept us\naway from worshipping idols. Everlasting praise be to Him, and permanent thanks be to\nHim. The interpretation of His Word, the Mighty and High: He begets not, nor is He\nbegotten, is as follows: He, the Mighty and High, has not given birth to have a son as an\nheir, nor is He begotten so that He would have a father who would share His Lordship\nand Kingdom; and none is like Him, so that another would assist Him in His Rule.",

And there will endure\nforever the Face of your Lord, the Lord of glory and honor.2 And He, the Mighty and High, says:\nEverything is perishable but His Face.3 Therefore, looking at Prophets of Allah, His Messengers\nand Proofs (AS) in their places is a great reward for the Believers on the Day of Judgment.\nHence, the Prophet (SA) has said: \"Whoever hates my Household and Progeny, will not see me, and I will not see him on the Day of Judgment.\" And he (AS) said: \"Verily, there is among you who will not see me after they have parted from me\"\nO Abu al-Salt!

Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil (RA) said: Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Sadabadi said on he\nauthority of Ahmad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Barqi, on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn Khalid, on\nthe authority of Ahmad ibn al-Nadr, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Marwan, on the authority of\nMuhammad ibn al-Sa'ib, on the authority of Abu al-Salih that Abd Allah ibn Abbas was asked to\ninterpret the Word of the Mighty and High: And when Musa came at Our appointed time and his\nLord spoke to him, he said: My Lord! Show me (Thyself), so that I may look upon Thee. He said: You\ncannot (bear to) see Me but look at the mountain, if it remains firm in its place, then will you see Me;\nbut when his Lord manifested to the mountain He made it crumble and Musa fell down in a swoon;\nthen when he recovered, the said: Glory be to Thee, I turn to Thee, and I am the first of the\nBelievers;1\nHe said: Musa (AS) said: \"Glory be to You, I turn to You from asking You to se You, and I am\nthe first of the Believes who bears witness that you cannot be seen.\"\nMuhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn, the Compiler of this book (RA) says: Verily, Musa (AS) knew that\nit is not possible to see Allah, the Mighty and High. He surely asked Allah, the Mighty and High, to\nshow Himself to him, so that he may look upon Him. Because his people insisted that he do so.\nTherefore, Musa (AS) asked the question to His Lord without taking permission from Him. He (AS)\nsaid: My Lord! Show me Yourself, so that I may look upon You. God replied: You cannot see Me but\nlook at the mountain, if it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me. The meaning of this is\nthat You will never se Me because the mountain never moves in any state. This is like the Word of\nAllah, the Mighty and High: They shall not enter the garden until the camel passes through the eye of\nthe needle.2\nThe meaning of this is that they will never enter the garden like the camel will never pass through the\neye of the needle, but when his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain i.e. manifested a sign from His\nSigns. That sign was a light from the lights which He had created; He cast down His Might on that\nmountain. He made it crumble and Musa fell down in a swoon from fear of the earthquake which was\nshaking that mountain with its power. Then, when he recovered, he said: \"Glory be to You, I turn to\nYou i.e. I return to my recognition of You, turning from my people and their request to see You.\"\nThis repentance was not the result of a sin, since prophets do not commit major or minor sins.\nThe permission before the question was not obligatory upon him; in fact, it was a form of politeness. He\nalways used to d this prior to asking a question. According to one group, he had taken permission before\nasking that vision was not applicable to Allah, the Mighty and High. Regarding his statement: And I am\nthe first of the Believers, Moses is saying that I am the first of the Believers from the group that were\nwith him. They had asked him to take permission from his Lord to show Himself, so that he may look\nupon Him.\nThe traditions that have transmitted regarding this subject, and which our elders (RA) have mentioned\nin their writings, are authentic as far as I am concerned. However, I refrained from transmitting them in\nthis chapter fearing that some ignorant people may read them and interpret them literally, rejecting\nthem, and disbelieving in Allah, the Mighty and High, out of ignorance.\nThe traditions that Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa has mentioned in his Nawadir and those which\nMuhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Yahya has mentioned in his Jami regarding the vision of Allah are\nauthentic. Only the ignorant and the unbelievers can reject them. Their wording is the wording of the\nQuran. These reports negate anthropomorphism [tashbih] and annulment [tatil] as a means of proving\nDivine Unity. Our Imams, may the blessings of Allah be upon them, have certainly ordered us not to\naddress people beyond the capacity of their intellect.\nIn these reports, the vision of Allah means the knowledge of Allah. In other words, this world is a place\nof doubt, uncertainty, and danger. Thus, when the Day of Judgment comes, the Signs of Allah and His\nCommand will unveil for His servants and deliver both reward and punishment. Doubt will be\neliminated, and all will attest to the reality and Omnipotence of Allah, the Mighty and High. The\nconfirmation of this is in the Book of Allah, Mighty and High: Certainly you were heedless of it, but\nnow We have removed from you your veil, so your sight today is sharp.1\nSo, the meaning of what is narrated in the tradition that He, the Mighty and High, will be seen is that He\nwill be known with understanding and surety like His Word, the Mighty and High: Have you not seen\nyour Lord, how He extends the shade?2 And His Word: Did you not see him (Namrud) who disputed\nwith Ibrahim about his Lord,3 and Hid Word: Did you not see those who went forth from their homes,\nin thousands, fearing death,4 and His Word: Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the fellows\nof the elephants?5\nAnd other examples of this include that vision refers to the vision of the heart, and not the vision of the\neyes. As for the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: but when his Lord manifested to the mountain, it\nmeans that He, the Mighty and High, made a sign appear as a Sign of the Signs of the hereafter which\nwill make mountains into a mirage, and which will uproot the mountains and scatter them away as dust.\nThe mountain crumbled and turned into dust, because it would not bear that sign. It is said: The light of\nthe throne manifested itself upon the mountain.", "Hadith": 22, "Chapter": 9}, {"Content": "23.

Do you not claim that the prophets (SA) are infallible?\"\nHe (AS) replied: \"Of course.\"\nHence, he asked him about the verses of the Quran. Among the questions he asked was:\nThen, what is the meaning of the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: And when Musa came at\nOur appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said: My Lord! Show me (Thyself), so that I\nmay look upon Thee. He said: You cannot (bear to) see Me?1 How is it possible that Musa son of\nImran (AS), to whom Allah ha spoken, did not know that Allah, Exalted be His Remembrance, cannot\nbe seen, thus leading him to ask that question?\nSo al-Rida (AS) answered:\nVerily, Musa ibn Imran (AS), to whom Allah has spoken, knew that Allah is far above being seen\nby human eyes. However, when Allah, the Mighty and High spoke to him, He made him draw\nnigh, Musa (AS) returned to his people and informed them that Allah, the Mighty and High, spoke\nto him and made him draw nigh. Therefore, the people responded: \"We will not believe in you\nuntil we hear His Speech like you head it.\"\nThe people were seven hundred thousand men. He chose seventy thousand from them. Then, from\nthese, he chose seven thousand. For these, he chose seven hundred. And, finally, from these seven\nhundred, he chose seventy men for the appointment of his Lord.\nHe then went out to Mount Sinai, and stood them on the mountain slope. Musa (AS) climbed the\nSinai, and asked Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, to speak to him, and to make them hear His\nSpeech. Thus, Allah, Exalted be His Remembrance, spoke to him, and they heard His Speech\nfrom above, below, right, left, behind and in front, because Allah, the Mighty and High, created it\nin the tree, then directed the sound to them from the tree to them until they could hear it from all\nsides. Then they said: \"We will not believe that this is the speech of Allah until we see Allah\nmanifestly.\"\nWhen they said these insolent words, they were all puffed up with pride. As a result, Allah, the\nMighty and high, seized them for their oppression and struck them with a thunderbolt, killing\nthem all. Musa (AS) then said: \"O Lord! What shall I say to the Israelites when I return to them\nand they say to me: You took them with you and killed them, because you were not truthful in\nyour claim that Allah drew night to you.\"\nThus, Allah raised them to life, and sent them with him. They then said: \"If you had asked Allah to\nshow Himself to you s that you could see Him, He would certainly have answered you. Then, you\ncould have described Him for us so that we could recognize Him they way He deserves to be\nrecognized.\"\nMusa (AS) said: \"O people! Verily, Allah cannot be seen by human eyes and He is not subject to\nshape. He can only be recognized by His Signs and can only known through His Attributes.\" They\nsaid: \"We will not believe in you until you ask Him.\" Hence, Musa (AS) said: \"O Lord! You\ncertainly heard the words of the Israelites, and You are the Most Knowledgeable of their interest. So\nAllah, Exalted be His Glory, revealed to him: \"O Musa! Ask Me what they have asked you for\nI will not resent you for their ignorance.\"\nAt this point Musa (AS) said:\nMy Lord! Show me (Thyself), so that I may look upon Thee. He said: You cannot see Me but\nlook at the mountain, if it remains firm in its place (while it is shaking), then will you see Me;\nbut when his Lord manifested to the mountain (a sign from His Signs) He made it crumble and\nMusa fell down in a swoon; then when he recovered, he said: Glory be to Thee, I turn to Thee (I\nam turning back to my recognition of You from the ignorance of my people), and I am the first of the\nBelievers to profess that You cannot be seen.2\nAl-Mamun expressed: \"For Allah's sake continue, O Abu al-Hasan.\"\nThe Compiler of this book says: The tradition is detailed; we have extracted from it the required\npassage. I have transmitted all of it in the book Uyun Akhbar al-Rida (AS). If I had transmitted all the\ntraditions which are narrated regarding the vision, surely the book would become lengthy with their\nmentioning, their explanation and proving their authenticity.\nWhoever Allah, Exalted be His Remembrance, grants success with right guidance, believe in all that is\ntransmitted with the authentic chain of narrations from the Imam (AS), submits to them (AS) and\nconsults their teachings when he is in doubt.

Tamim ibn Abd Allah ibn Tamim al-Qurashi (RA) said: My father related to me, on the authority of Hamdan ibn Sulayman al-Naysaburi, on the authority of Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Jahm that I attended al-Mamun's assembly while al-Rida Ali ibn Musa (AS) was with him. Al-Mamun asked him: \"O son of the Messenger of Allah (SA)! Do you not claim that the Prophets are infallible?\" He (AS) replied: \"Certainly.\" He asked him (AS) about some verses from the Quran. Among his questions was: \"Then tell me about the Word of Ibrahim (AS): My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead, He said: What! And do you not believe? He said: Yes, but that my heat may be at ease.\"1 Al-Rida (AS) replied, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, revealed to Ibrahim (AS) that I will choose a friend for Me from among My Servants such that I will even revive the dead for him if he asks Me to do so. It then occurred to Ibrahim (AS) that he was that friend. Thus, he asked, \"My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead.\" He said: \"What! And do you not believe?\" He said: \"Yes, but my heart will be at ease knowing that I am your Friend.\" Then Allah said: Then take four of the birds, then train them to follow you, then place on every mountain a part of them, then call them, they will come to you flying; and know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.\"2 Then Ibrahim (AS) took an eagle, a peacock, a duck, and a rooster. He chopped them into pieces and mixed them up. He then placed a part of their mixed flesh on top of each of the ten hills in that area. He held each bird's beak in his hand. He placed some seeds and water near himself and called out to them. The various parts of beach bird started to fly towards each other until a perfect body was formed. Each body went towards its own head and joined it to become a living bird. Then Ibrahim (AS) let their beaks go. The birds flew and then landed. They drank water, ate some seeds, and said: \"O Prophet of Allah! You have brought us back to life. May Allah bring you back to life.\" Ibrahim (AS) said: \"It is Allah who brings back to life and takes away life. He has power over all things.\" Al-Mamun said: \"May Allah bless you, O Abu al-Hasan!\" The Compiler of this book says: The tradition is detailed; we have extracted from it the required passage. I have transmitted all of it in the book Uyun Akhbar al-Rida (AS).",

He is All-Hearing and All-Seeing, but without the use of visual or auditory organs. Rather, He hears by Himself, and He sees by Himself. My statement is not that He hears by Himself in the sense that His Hearing is one thing, and His Self is another. Rather, my goal is to respond to what I was asked using terminology that can be readily understood. Hence, when I say that He hears by means of His Entire Essence, I say so to stress that He is not composed of parts. MY goal is to make you understand. My only other recourse would be to say that He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing, All-Knowing, and All-Aware without any conflict between essence and concept.",

And the one which came out form the Earth asked the one which came down form Heaven, \"Where have you come from?\" He said: \"I have come from y Lord.\" This took place during the lifetime of your Prophet Musa (AS), and as for what was in the lifetime of our Prophet Muhammad (SA), then that is His word in His Decisive Book: Nowhere is there a secret counsel between three persons but He is the fourth of them, nor (between) five but He is the sixth of them nor less than that nor more but He is with them where so ever they are.\" The two Jewish men enquired, \"Then what has stopped your two companions from putting you in the place which you deserve? We swear by the One who revealed the Torah to Musa (AS): Verily, you are the True Caliph. We find your description in our Book, and we read it in our synagogues. Verily, you are more worth of this affair and more entitled to it than the one who has snatched it away from you.\" Ali (AS) replied, \"The two of them preceded themselves and obstructed me. Their accountability is with Allah, the Mighty and High. They will be stopped and questioned (on the Day of Judgment).\"",

Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Majilwayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim said, on the authority of al-Mukhtar ibn Muhammad ibn al-Mukhtar al-Hamdani said, on the authority of al-Fath ibn Yazid al-Jurjani, that I heard Abu al-Hasan al-Rida (AS) say: He is the Subtle, the All-Aware, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the One, the Unique, the Needless, who begets not nor is begotten, and there is none like unto Him. He is the Producer of all Things, the Former of Bodies, and the Maker of Images. If He was as they say, then the Creator would not be distinguished from the created, nor the Producer from the production. However, He is the Producer. The difference between Him and bodes and images I that he created them, and there is nothing like unto Him. I asked, \"By all means. May Allah make me your ransom! However, you said: The Alone, the Needless' and you also said: He is not like anything.' If Allah is One, and man is one, are they not similar in unity?\" He (AS) replied, O Fath! You paid attention, may Allah secure you! Verily, the similarity is limited to meaning. Identifiers are merely means of identifying the identified. If it is said that there is one man, it means that there is one body, as opposed to two. However, although we say that man is one, he is not truly one, as he has different body parts and different colors. Although we say that he is one, he is composed of many different parts which are not he same. His blood is other than his flesh, his flesh is other than his blood, his nerves are other than his veins, his hair is other than his skin, and the darkness of his skin is other than the paleness of his skin. Likewise is the rest of creation. Thus, the human being is \"one\" in name, but he is other than \"one\" in meaning. Not only is Allah, lofty be His Majesty, One in name, He is also One in meaning as there is none other than Him. There is no variation in Him, no contrast, nor any increase or decrease. As a crated being, the human being is composed of different parts and substances. H e is one \"one\" in combination. I enquired: \"You have relieved me. May Allah relieve you! As for your statement: The Subtle, All-Aware,' could you explain it to me as you explained to me the meaning of the One.' I really need to know how His Subtlety is different from the subtlety of His Creation. I would surely appreciate it if you could explain that to me.\" Therefore, he (AS) answered: O Fath! We had said: He is the Subtle due to the delicate nature of His Creation, and for His Knowledge of tiny things. Do you not see, may Allah help you and secure you, the effect of His Making in soft and hard plants? And do you not see in the delicate creation of tiny insects like the mosquito, the gnat, and that which is smaller than these two, and are almost not evident to the (naked) eyes? In fact, due to their small size, it is virtually impossible to differentiate between the male and the female, and between the young and the old. Thus, we come to know that the Creator is Subtle in His Creation when we see the smallness of creatures in their refinement, their guidance out of decay, and their fleeing from death. We come to know that the Creator is Subtle when we contemplate the creatures found teeming in the depths of the ocean, on the branches of trees, and in the deserts and barren lands. We come to know the Creator is Subtle when we contemplate how species communicate with one another using various forms of communication, permitting them to communicate with their offspring. We come to know that the Creator is Subtle when we contemplate how creatures provide food to their offspring, and how they are distinguished by colors, red with yellow, white with red, and with what we can barely see with our eyes due to its small size. We come to know that the Creator is Subtle when we contemplate the creatures that our eyes cannot see and our hands cannot touch. He created the world in subtlety without planning, without instruments, and without tools. Verily, the founder of anything founded it on the basis of another. However, Allah, the Creator, the Subtle, and the Sublime, created everything out of nothing.",

    "Content": "2. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Yaqub alKulayni said: Ali ibn Muhammad, said, on the authority Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Khalid that Abu al-Hasan al-Rida (AS) said: May Allah bestow upon you knowledge of what is good! Know that Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is Eternal. Eternity is an attribute through which the wise understand that there was nothing before Him in eternity, and that there is nothing alongside Him in eternity. Even the common folk acknowledge that nothing existed before Allah, and that nothing exists alongside Him. At the same time, it invalidates the claim that there was something before Him. Had there been something eternal along with Him. He would not have been the Creator of that thing. If something existed along with Him, how then would He have been its Creator? Had there been something existing before Him, then that thing would have been worthier of being His Creator because it existed before Him. The blessed and Exalted ascribed certain names to Himself. When He created his creatures, He enabled them to serve Him, and told His creatures to call Him by those names. He called Himself the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Riser ]qaim], the Manifest, the Hidden, the Subtle, the All-Aware, the Powerful, the Honorable, the All-Wise, and the All-Knowing, among other similar names. When the lying exaggerators [ghalun] heard us talk about such names, that there is nothing similar to Him, and that none of the creatures are like unto Him, they said: \"When you say that there is nothing like unto Him, and nothing is similar to Him, then how can you share with Him His Most Beautiful Names, and apply them to yourselves? Thus, this is proof that you are similar to Him in all conditions or in some conditions because you share the same purified names.\" It is said to them: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has named His Servants with some of His own Names but with differences in meaning just like one name may have two different meanings. The proof of this can be found among he common people. This is the way in which Allah, the Mighty and High, has addressed the creation. He has spoken to them by means of things that they understand so that the will have no excuse for their misdeeds. A man is sometimes called a dog, a donkey, a bull or a lion just like he can be called sweet or bitter. All of these words are used with a n allegorical meaning which differs from their literal meaning. A man cannot literally be a lion or a dog. Please pay close attention to this, May Allah have mercy on you! Verily, we say that Allah is All-Knowing, and not that He crated knowledge. It does not mean that He uses his Knowledge in order to record His Future Commands or His Process of Creation and Destruction because had that knowledge not been present that would imply ignorance or weakness. Likewise, the learned among creation are called knowledgeable because they possess created knowledge, which they did not have at some time in the past. They may lose their knowledge at some point and become ignorant again. However, Allah is called All-Knowing because He is not ignorant of anything. Thus, the Creator and the created are both called knowing, but the meaning is different as you have noticed.Our Lord is called All-Hearing. However, this is not through a body part or sensory organ without which He could not hear the sound as is the case with us. We cannot see with the part with which we hear. However, He has told us that no sound is hidden from Him. His hearing is not limited, as it is in our case. Here again the name hearing is used in both cases, but its meaning is different. The same applies for seeing. He does not see by means of an eye as we do. We see using a body part which serves that sole purpose. However, Allah is All-Seeing, and is never unaware of any individual. Again, the same name is used in both cases, but its meaning is different. He is Standing, but not in the sense of standing of His Les as would be the case for other beings. However, He informed us that He is Sanding, and that He is the Guardian. This is like the saying \"A man is standing behind our affairs.\" He is Standing behind every soul watching what is gains. As used by people, the word \"standing\" also has meanings like sufficing.' As you may say to a man, \"Stand up for the affairs of so and so\" which means to deal with them in a sufficient manner. Standing for us means that we stand on our legs. Therefore, the name is similar but its meaning is different. As for the term Subtle, it is Subtle, it is not used in the sense of smallness or being infinitesimal. Rather, it is used to express how difficult it is to perceive things. As an example, it may be said: \"It has become very delicate for me,\" and that \"so and so is very delicate in his manners and dealings.\" This means that it is profound for the intellect, and it is very difficult to understand. It has become so delicate that it cannot even be perceived by means of the imagination. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is far more Subtle than to be comprehended through definitions or be limited by an attribute in the way we are subtle, small and delicate. Names can be the same but they can differ in meaning. As for the All-Aware, it means that He is the One who Knows all Things, Completely, but not through study or experience, without which He would know nothing. One without experience and training is ignorant. Allah is always All-Aware of what He ha created. The people who are well are those people who are learning to overcome their ignorance. Thus, names are the same but again, they differ in meaning. As for the Manifest, it does not mean that He is over and above all things or sitting on the uppermost part of them. Rather, it refers to His Dominion and His Power over All Things. An example of this would be when a person says, \"I overcame my enemies\" or that \"Allah granted me victory over my enemies.\" In this case, there is a report of failure and victory. Thus, this shows Allah's Dominion over all enemies.Another illustration that He is Manifest is that for those who intend Him, nothing is hidden form Him, and He is the Planner of all that can be seen. What can be clearer or more manifest than Allah, the Exalted? No matter where you look, His Presence will never vanish. Even within you, His Traces are sufficient proof for His Existence. However, what is manifested in us is apparent, and its limits are known. Therefore, the names are thee same, but their meanings differ. As for the Hidden, it does not mean that He is inside things. Rather, it refers to His Inner Knowledge of all things from their planning to their preserving. As one may say, \"I tried to get to the inside of the matter,\" that is, \"I came to learn and discover his secrets.\" For us, what is hidden is what is unseen and covered. Once again, the names are the same, but they differ in meaning. As for the Subduer, it does not refer to plotting, using certain devices, speaking seductive words, or using cunning means as some people do to subdue one another. The victorious among the people may become subdued, and vice versa. However, for Allah, the Blessed and Exalted,, all creatures are weak. Due to the absence of obstacles in what He wills for them, it takes less than a blinking of the eye for Him to say \"Be and it is.\" Subduing in our case is how I mentioned and explained. Thus, names are alike but their meanings differ. That is the case for all the names, although we have not mentioned all of them. We will suffice with this for learning purpose. May Allah be our Helper and your Helper assuring our guidance and success!",

He cannot be uttered by words, cannot be embodied in person, cannot be described by anthropomorphism, and cannot be colored by colors. Regions are negated from Him. Limits are far from Him. The sense of every imaginer is covered from Him. He is understood and not hidden. Hence, He has made it a complete word in four parts altogether. Neither one of them precedes the other. Then he showed three of those names to creation out of their need for them, and hid one of them. That is the well-kept treasured name through which these names were manifested. Thus, the apparent is Allah, the Blessed and Exalted. He, glory be to Him, utilized each one of the four first principles, and that became twelve principles. Then He created for each of the principles thirty names, in effect, related to them. They are the Most Compassionate, the most Merciful, the Sovereign, the Most Holy, the Creator, the Maker [al-Bari'], the Imager, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsistent [al-Qayyum], slumber seized Him not, nor does sleep, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware, the All-Hearing, the all-Seeing, the Most Wise, the Honorable, the Supreme, the Possessor of all Greatness [al-Mutakabbir], the Most High, the Most Great, the All-Powerful [al-Muqtadir], the Omnipotent, the Giver of Peace [al-Salam], the Granter of Security [al-Mumum], the Guardian over All [al-Muhaymin], the Maker, the Producer, the Originator [al-Badi'], the Lofty [al-Rafi].

Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Kufi said: Muhammad ibn Bishr related to me, on the authority of Abu Hashim alJafari that I was with Abu Jafar the Second (AS), when a man asked him, \"Inform me about the Lord, the Blessed and Exalted. There are names and attributes for Him in His Book. Are those His Only Names and attributes?\" Consequently, Abu Jafar (AS) replied, Verily, there are two interpretations to your question. If you are referring to quantity, then Exalted is Allah from such limitations. However, if you wanted to know whether these attributes and names have always existed, then there are two possibilities. Either they have always been part of His Knowledge, and He has always deserved them, and this is true. However, if you want to now whether the image of these attributes and names, their alphabets, and their form, have always been there, then may Allah save me from the claim that something has existed alongside Him. In fact, Allah existed when no creation existed. Then He created the names as a means for His Creation to beseech Him and serve Him. They are the means through which He is remembered. Allah was there when no remembrance existed. The One who is Remembered is Allah, the Eternal, who has always existed. The Names and Attributes are creation of meanings. What is meant by them is that Allah is not subject to agreement or disagreement, since only one with parts disagrees or agrees. Hence, it is not said: Allah agreed, nor that Allah is more or less. However, He is Eternal in His Essence, because whatever is other than One has parts, and Allah is the One without Parts. He cannot be imagines as less, nor can he be imagines as more. Anything composed of parts, and which can be conceived as less or conceived as more, was created by a Creator Thus, when you say that \"Verily, Allah is Omnipotent\" you are affirming that nothing incapacitates Him. Therefore, you have negate the word: \"incapable,\" and applied it to other than Him. Likewise, by your use of the word: \"All-Knowing\" you have indeed negated ignorance and related ignorance to other than Him. When Allah causes all things to perish, He will cause images and alphabets to perish. Nevertheless, He, who has always been All-Knowing, will never expire or decline. The man asked, \"How can our Lord be called the All-Hearing?\" He (AS) answered, That is because nothing which is understood by means of hearing is hidden form Him. We do not claim that He hears through ears. Likewise, when we call Him All-Seeing, we say so because nothing visual is hidden from Him: be it colors, people, or other objects. We do not claim that He sees through eyes. We call Him the Subtle One due to His knowledge of subtle things like the mosquito, and for His Knowledge of creatures which are even smaller than that. We call Him the subtle One because of His Knowledge of the place of their division, their thoughts, their needs, their reproductive cycle, their affection for offspring, their means of communication, their bringing of food and drink to their offspring in the mountains, deserts, valleys, and wastelands (of the worlds). We come to know that the Creator of these things is the Subtle One without quality. Verily, quality applies only to the created. Our Lord is called the Powerful One, but not with the same type of power found among created beings. If His Power were like the power found among created beings, then He would be compared to His Creation, and He would be susceptible to both increase and decrease and could not be Eternal. Whatever is not eternal is powerless. Thus, our Lord, the Blessed and Exalted, has no compeer [shibh], no opponent, no equal, no quality, no end, and no regions. The mind is incapable of conceiving Him, the imagination is incapable of limiting Him, and the conscience is incapable of placing conditions on Him. He is Higher than the implements of His Creation and characteristics of His Creatures. Exalted is He, the Elevated and Great, from such things!",

    "Content": "9. Ahmad ibn Ziyad ibn Jafar al-Hamdani (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim said on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abu al-Salt Abd alSalam ibn Salih al-Harawi, on the authority of Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS), on the authority of his father (AS), on the authority of his forefathers (AS), on the authority of Ali (AS) that The Messenger of Allah (SA) said: \"For Allah, the Mighty and High, are Ninety-Nine Names. Whoever calls Allah by them, He will grant him what he asks. And whoever enumerates them shall enter Paradise.\" Muhammad ibn Ali al-Husayn, the Compiler of this book explains: The meaning of the statement of the Prophet, praise and salutations of Allah be upon him and his Progeny, is that indeed Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, the has Ninety-Nine names. Whoever enumerates them will enter Paradise. Enumerating the names means to encompass them, and understand their meanings. The meaning of enumerating them is not simply to count them or to number them. All success depends upon Allah. Allah, God [Allah, al-Ilah], Allah and Ilah means the worthy of service, and no one has the right to be served but Him. You may say: He was One God in the sense that He had the right to be served. This is why, when the infidels went astray, and determined that the worshipping idols is mandatory, they names them gods [al-ihah]. Its origin is al-ilahah, that is service (worship). It is said: Its origin is al-ilah, it si said; aliha al-rajul ya'lahu ilayh i.e. he took refuge to it fro an affair that afflicted him. Alihahu i.e. he aided him. The explanation of the Imam's (AS) statement is as follows: Then two As' [hamzahs] had combined in one word, due to a common use of the word, and its heavy pronunciation, the original A' [Hamzah] was omitted, because they found in the shortened word sounded similar to its full form. Then the two Ls' [lam] were combined, the first of the two did not contain a vowel, so they assimilated it into the second. Thus, it became a doubled letter in your word: Allah [Allah]. The One, the Alone [al-Wahid, al-Ahad], the meaning of al-Ahad is that He is One in His Essence, not possessing parts, components, and limbs. Nor is it permissible to number Him and ascribe change to Him, because change in things is evidence of His Oneness, which applies only to Him. It is said: Allah has always been One. The second meaning is that He is One, there is no equal to Him. Therefore, no one shares with Him the meaning of Oneness, because all those that have equals and likes are not one in reality. It is also said: he is one of a kind, i.e. there is no equal to him in what he is attributed with. Allah is One, but not numerically, because He, the Mighty and High, is not counted among the genus, but He is One, there is no equal to Him. Some of the philosophers have said about the One and the Alone: Verily, it has been said: He is One, because He is Solitary and He is the First, because He has no second. Then He originate all the creation in need of each other. The numerical \"one\" has nothing before it. In fact, it comes before all numbers. However way you perceive it or divide it, nothing increases or decreases the number one. When you say: one divided by one equals one, nothing increases it, and the word does not change from one. Therefore, the number one indicates that nothing came before Him. Thus, if it indicates that nothing came before Him, it indicates that He is the One that brought things about. If He is the One that brought things about, it indicates that He is the destroyer of Things. If He is the Destroyer of things, then it indicates that nothing is after Him. Hence, if there is nothing before Him, and nothing after Him, then He is the Solitary sempiternally. This is why it is said: the One, the Alone. There are certain characteristics of the Alone [al-Ahad] that are not present in the One [al-Wahid]. You may say: There is not any one [Wahid] in the house. It can mean that there is no animal, no bird, no beast, or no human in the house. Therefore, the number one can refer to people or other than people. However, when you say there is no one [Ahad] in the house, it is limited to human beings, and others are excluded. The Unique cannot be subject to multiplication, number, division, and calculation. It is Alone in Uniqueness. The number one, however, can be subject to the shortcomings of numbers, divisions, and calculations. You can say: one, two, three... and these are numbers. They number one, however, is the cause of numbers, is outside of numbers, and is not a number. For example, one can say: one multiplied by two or three, or any higher numerals. Thus, this is multiplication. And you may say: two divided by one... Hence, this is division. However, the Alone cannot be subjected to arithmetic. Hence, it cannot be said: along [Ahad], two, nor alone divided by one... It is neither said: alone divided by two... The Needless [al-Samad], its meaning is the Master. Whoever accepts this meaning then it is permissible for him to say: He has always been the Needless [Samad]. It is said that nobody administers the affairs of the nation but the ruling authority who is obeyed [Samad]. AS a poet has said: I lifted my sword (to take his life) then said to him Take it, O Hudhayfa, as you are the master who is obeyed [Samad] There is another meaning for the Samad and that is the objective in the needs. It is said: I seek him. However, whoever accepts this meaning, then it is not permissible for him to say: He has always been the Objectie [samad], because he has attributed Himj, the Mighty and High, with an attribute from the Attributes of Action. This meaning is also correct. Samad has neither a body nor an interior. I have explained other meanings of Samad in the Commentary of Chapter 112 of the Quran in this Book, which I do not wish to repeat in this chapter. The First, the Last [al-Awwal, al-Akhir], their meanings are that He is the First without a beginning, and the Last without an end. The All-Hearing [al-Sami], the meaning of this is that if anything audible is found then He is its Hearer. The other meaning is that He is the Listener of the prayer i.e. answerer of the prayer. In order to be Hearing [Sami], sound needs to exist. Hence, it is not permissible to say that Hearing is an attribute of His Essence, Mighty be His Name. The All-Seeing [al-Basir], the meaning of this is that if there is anything that can be seeing, then He perceives it. This is why it is permissible to say: He has always been All-Seeing. While it is not permissible to say: He has always been made to see [mubsir], because that is transitive, and requires existence. The word \"perception\" [basarah] is literally a root-word for All-Seeing [basir], and [basura]. Allah, the Mighty and High, is All-Seeing in His Essence. We have not attributed for Him, the Blessed and Exalted, that He is All-Hearing, and All-Seeing, as an attribute that He is All-Knowing (of the two), but what we have stated intends that He perceives. This is a characteristic of all living beings, and there is no calamity in it. The Omnipotent, the Subduer [al-Qadir, al-Qahir], the meaning of these two is that things are unable to refuse His Will. It is said: Verily, the Omnipotent is one from whom any action is possible, so long as it is not impossible. To subdue [qahr] is to overpower [ghalabah]. Omnipotence [qudrah] is a root-word in the statement: he possessed power i.e. controlled [malaka]. Therefore, He is the Omnipotent [qadir], the All-Powerful [qadir], and the Potent [muqtadir]. His Omnipotence extends even to what does not exist and His Potency is present at His Innovation, namely, His Power and His Sovereignty over it. He, Mighty be His Remembrance, has said: Master of the Day of Judgment. The Day of Judgment does not yet exist. It is said: Verily, He, the Mighty and High, has always been the Subduer. The meaning of this is that things do not have the capability of refusal to Him and to what He intends to execute in them. He has always been the Potent over them even when they did not exists, like it is said: Master of the Day of Judgment, while the Day of Judgment does not exist yet. The Most High, the Most Sublime [al--Ali, al-Ala], the meaning of al-Ali is the Subduer. Therefore, Allah is the Subduer, Possessor of Highness [dhu al-Ula], Loftiness [al-Ala] and Elevation [al-Taali] i.e. Omnipotent. It is said: the king is exalted in might. It is also said for everything that is lofty: it was high, it will be elevated, it is lofty, it will be lofty... The word al-Malat is derived from al-Maali and literally means to acquire nobility. The ilw of everything is its higher part: so and so is a prominent figure in people [ilyat al-nas] and it is a noun. The meanings of elevating, ascending, and descending, do no apply to Allah, the Blessed and Exalted. The other meaning is that He, Exalted is He, is above resemblances, equals, whatever goes into a subject, whatever the ignorant image, and what spontaneous thought. Therefore, He, the elevated and Great, is More Lofty [Mutaalin] than what the oppressors say. As for the Most Sublime [al-Ala], its meaning is the Most High, and the Subduer. The Word of the Mighty and High to Musa endorses this: Fear not, surely you shall be the uppermost, i.e. the subduer. Also the Word of the Mighty and High in inciting the Believers to combat: And be not infirm, and be not grieving, and you shall have the upper hand [al-a'lawn] if you are Believers. And the Word of the Mighty and High: Surely Fir'awn exalted himself in the land, i.e. overpowered them and captured them. A poet has said in this meaning: Thus, when we overpowered and captured them, We left them on the ground for the vultures and birds of prey. The second meaning is that He is Lofty i.e. unblemished from resemblances and equals, like He says: Exalted is He far above what they associate (with Him). The Ever-Remaining [al-Baqi], its meaning is the Being who has not come about, and who will never perish. Remaining is contrary to perishing... It is said: nothing remains of them, and Allah did not preserve anything of them. The Everlasting is one of His Attributes. He is also the Ever-Remaining, who does not become extinct, nor perish. The Originator [al-Badi], its meaning is Creator of Original Creations, and Inventor of the Things without prior example and imitation. Grammatically, it belongs to the nominal type (on the scale of) fail in the meaning of active participle mufil, like in the word of the Mighty and High: A painful chastisement [adhabun alim], while the meaning is not receiving pain, but rather giving pain. The Arabs say: He hit (receiving pain), and he hit (causing pain) A poet said: Is he a good reader and listener? Who wakes me and my friends while we are peacefully sleeping? Therefore, the meaning of listening would be listener. The origin [bid] of a thing is the first of it. As we read in the Word of the Mighty and High: Say: I am not the first [bidan] of the messengers, i.e. not the first. Al-Bidat also applies to first or innovations in matters of religion, etc. A poet said: Your palms are not created for generosity. And their miserliness is not something new. Hence, one fist is clenched from good Like it has decreased from a hundred to seven. Whereas the other one has three thousand And nine hundred as a habit. It is also said: You have come up with an original matter, i.e. amazing invention. The Maker [al-Bari], its meaning is that He is the Maker of Creatures, i.e. the Creator of the Creations. He made them, i.e. He created the. The creature is creation. Most of the Arabs avoid the last vowel (the [] sound at its end). It is an active participle with the sense of a passive participle, and some of them have said: it is taken from \"shaping the wood,\" some claim that it is form al-Bary, which is dust, i.e. He has created them from dust, and they say: This why it does not contain the vowel at its end. The Most Generous [al-Akram], its meaning is al-Karim. Sometimes the elative expresses the meaning of the nominal type, like the Word of the Mighty and High: And it is easier [ahwan] to Him, i.e. it is easy [hayyin] to Him. Like the Word of the Mighty and High: None shall enter it but the most unhappy [al-ashqa], and His Word: And away from it shall be kept the one who guards most [al-atqa] (against evil), what is meant by the most unhappy, and the one who guards against what is adverse [al-shaqi], and one who guards [al-taqi]. A poet has said: Verily, the One who created the heaven as a roof for us Created a house with taller, more powerful, pillars, for us. The Manifest [al-Zahir], its meaning is that He is manifest through His Signs, in which He has concealed witnesses of His Omnipotence, traces of His Wisdom, and evidence of His Clear Proof. The created are unable to create the most insignificant of it. Like Allah, the Mighty and High, says: Surely those whom you call upon besides Allah cannot create a fly, though they should al gather for it. Therefore, there is nothing in His Creation that does not profess His Unity. The Blessed and Exalted avoided describing His Essence. Hence, He is manifested through His signs and Witnesses of His Omnipotence. He is Predominant, and All-Powerful over whatever He wills. This is found in the Word of the Mighty and High: And they became uppermost, i.e. predominant over them. The Hidden [al-Batin], its meaning is that He is Hidden from Imagination. Therefore, He is Hidden without Encompassment. Nothing encompasses Him, because He has been there prior to the thoughts. Hence, thoughts are subject to Him. The Known has preceded everything and cannot be encompassed. Imaginations pas away; hence, they cannot explore Him. Therefore, He is the Hidden of all Hidden and the Covered of all Covered. He is Hidden in His Essence, and manifest and Lofty in His signs. Consequently, He is the Hidden without any cover and Manifest without any approximation. The other meaning of this is that He is the Interior [batin] of everything i.e. All-Aware and All-Seeing of what they keep secret and what they disclose, and of whatever is sowed and created. The entourage [batanat] of a man is composed of people he trusts with his personal affairs. The meaning is that He is All-Knowing of their secrets, not that He, the Mighty and High, hides in a thing disguising in it. The Ever-Living [al-Hai], its meaning is that He is the Mighty Doer [al-Faal] and the Director [al-Mudabbir]. He is Ever-Living by His Own Accord. Death and annihilation are impossible for Him. He does not need life in order to live. The All-Wise [al-Hakim], its meaning is that He is all-Knowing. The wisdom is literally the knowledge. As we read in the Word of the Mighty and High: He grants wisdom to whom He pleases, (i.e. He grants knowledge). The second meaning is that He is Precise [Muhkam], and His actions are firm and free from corruption. Hakamtuhu (I commanded him) and ahkamtuhu (I planned the action precisely) are two literal words. A part of horse's bridle [Hakamah] is named by such, because it stops a sever blow, and it is what encompasses its mouth. The Omniscient [al-Alim], its meaning is that He is All-Knowing by Himself. He is All-Knowing of secrets and All-Informed of minds. The littlest of the things is not hidden from Him, nor can the weight of an atom escape from Him. He knows things before they take pale and after He brings them about. He knows what they do in secret, and what they do in public. He knows what is apparent, and what is hidden. The Mighty and High's knowledge of things is unlike the creatures' knowledge. Thus, it stands to reason that He, the Blessed and Exalted, is dissimilar from them in every sense. Allah is omniscient in His Essence. The Omniscient is the Cause of Firm and Accurate Action. Therefore, it is not said: Verily, He knows things through knowledge; just as nothing eternal exist alongside Him. In fact, it is said: Verily, He is Omniscient by Essence. Thus, such is said in all of His Attributes of Essence. The Forbearing [al-Halim], the meaning of this is that He is Forbearing of whoever disobeys Him. He does not hasten in His Punishment. The Protector [al-Hafiz], al-hafiz is al-hafiz, that is nominal type of the active participle. Its meaning is that He protects things and averts from them tribulation. He cannot be attributed with protecting in the sense of learning, because we use protecting' (in the sense of learning) when we speak metaphorically of the Quran and other arts. The reason we do so is that when we learn something and memorize something, it does not leave us. Hence, we protect it. The Truth [al-Haqq], is an active participle, al-Muhiqq (in the right). He is attributed with it metaphorically because it is the infinitive. It is like their statement \"aid of those who call for help\" [ghiyath al-mustaghuthin]. The other meaning that is intended by it is that service of Allah is the truth, and service to other than Him is falsehood. The Word of the Mighty and High endorse this: That is because Allah is the Truth, and that what they call upon besides Him that is the falsehood, i.e. it becomes falsehood, leaves, and does not promise anyone reward or punishment. The Reckoner [al-Hasib], its meaning is that He accounts [al-Muhsi] for everything. He has knowledge of them and nothing is hidden from Him. The second meaning is that He is the One who Holds Account [al-Muhasib] for His Servants. He holds them accountable for their actions and rewards them for those actions. It is a nominal type of the active participle similar to jails and mujalis (sitting in someone's company). The third meaning is that: He is Sufficient for us. This thing is enough for me, i.e. sufficient for me. I reckoned him i.e. I bestowed upon him until he said: \"enough for me.\" This is seen in the Word of the Mighty and High: A reward for your Lord, a gift according to a reckoning, i.e. a sufficiency. The Praiseworthy [al-Hamid], the meaning of this is the Praised one [al-Mahmud]; it is the nominal type of passive participle. Praise is opposite of censure. It is said: I praised so and so when I was pleased with his action, and spread it among the people. The Most Gracious [al-Hafi], its meaning is the All-Knowing. As we see in the Word of the Mighty and High: They ask you as if you were solicitous about it, i.e. they ask you about the hour (Day of Judgment) as if you know the time of its coming. The other meaning is that He is the Subtle. Al-higayah is the infinitive; al-Hafi is the Subtle, the One that honors you for your goodness and kindness. The Lord [al-Rabb], its meaning is the Master. Whoever possesses a thing is its lord. As we see in the Word of the Mighty and High: Go back to your lord, i.e. to your Master and Sovereign. Someone in the Battle of Hunayn said: \"If",

    "Content": "1. My father, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Sad ibn Abd Allah on the authority of\nYaqub ibn Yazid on the authority of al-Abbas ibn Hilal that\n\nI asked al-Rida (AS) about the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: \"Allah is the Light of\nthe Heavens and the Earth.\" So he replied (AS): \"He is the Guide of the Inhabitants of\nHeaven and the Guide of the Inhabitants of the Earth.\" While the narration of al-Barqi\nstates: \"He guides whatever is in the Heavens, and He guides whatever is in the Earth.\"\nThe Compiler of this book says: The anthropomorphist interpret this verse as He is the Light of\nthe Heavens and the Earth. If that were correct, how is it possible to find darkness on the\nEarth at any time, be it day or night? If Allah was the Light of the Heavens, and the Earth,\naccording to their interpretation, He would have to be perpetually present, and could not be\nnon-existent at times. Therefore, when we find the Earth dark at night, and when we find the\ninside of the Earth dark (even) during the day, then this indicates that the interpretation of :\n\"Allah is the Light of heaves, and the Earth,\" is what al-Rida (AS) has said and not that the\nanthromorphists have given. So, verily, He, the Mighty and High, is the Guide of the\nInhabitants in the Heavens and the Earth, and the Indicator [Mubayyin] for the Inhabitants of\nthe Heavens and the Earth in their religious and worldly affairs. In the same way that the\ninhabitants of the Heavens and the Earth are guided by Allah in their religious affairs, they are\nguided by the Light that Allah has created for them in the Heavens and the Earth in their\nworldly affairs. This is what He meant when He said that He was the Light of the Heaves and\nthe Earth. The attribute He applied to Himself is metaphorical since, intellectually - speaking, it\nis not logical for Allah, the Mighty and High, to be light or to glow, or to belong to the realm of\nlights, for the simple fact that He is the Creator of Light. His Statement also applies to the\nverse: \"A likeness of His Light.\" Verily, He intended by it the description of His Light. Evidently,\nthis Light is other than Him since He anthropomorphized it with the lamp and its glow, as He\nmentioned and described in this verse. It is not permissible to anthropomorphize His Being\nwith the lamp, because there is no likeness and no equivalent to Allah. Therefore, it is correct\nto say that His Light, which He anthropomorphized with a lamp, refers to His Guidance. It\nrefers to the fact that He guides the inhabitants of the Heaves and the Earth towards His\nReligion, towards divine Unity, toward His Wisdom, and towards His Justice. After explaining\n159\nthe Clearness of His Guidance and naming it \"Light,\" as He guides with it His Servants to His\nReligion and what is in their best interests, He said: A likeness of it is a niche in which is a\nlamp, the lamp is in a clear glass that resembles a brightly shining star in its clearness. The\nbrightly shining star is a star that resembles a pearl in its color. This lamp, which is in a clear\nglass, light from a blessed olive oil. He has intended by this Syrian oil, because it is said: It is\nblessed for its inhabitants. By \"Neither eastern nor western,\" the Mighty and High means that\nthis oil is neither eastern, so that he sun does not shine on it at the time of sunset, nor western\nso that the sun does not shine on it at the time of sunrise. Rather, it is from the upper part of\nthe tree and the sun shines on it throughout the day. This is what makes it the best, and\nmakes its oil light. He then emphasized the clearness of its oil; that \"the oil whereof almost\ngives light through fire touches it not\" to describe its clarity. He explains that the religious\nguidance that Allah gives His Servants in the Heavens and the Earth, is clear, and its\nexplanation, which is the clear glass, is equally clear. The fire ignites the clear oil as He\ndescribed. The glow of the fire combines with the glow of glass and the glow of oil in it. This is\nthe meaning of His Word: \"light upon light,\" and this is what He, the Mighty and High, meant:\n\"Allah guides to His light whom He pleases.\" That is, from His Servants who have reached the\nage of maturity so that they may recognize by that and be guided through it, and reason with\nit, regarding the unity of their Lord, and all religious matters. Allah, the Mighty and High, has\nindicated by this verse what He has mentioned of His Clear Indications and Signs with which\nHe guides His Servants in their religion. In other words, none of them have been left in\nignorance. If any of them neglect their religion, it is not due to vagueness or ambiguity on\nbehalf of Allah, the Mighty and High, since Allah, the Mighty and High, has explained to them\nHis Indications and Signs. Verily, they come to make mistake, due to forgetting about Allah's\nsings and failing to derive through these signs the existence of Allah, the Mighty and High,\nand what is in their best religious interest. He has also explained that He Is All-Knowing when\nit comes to the interest of His Servants.",

The Earth is not free at any time from at least one of them\n(AS). The proof of this statement can be found in the words of Abu Talib (AS) regarding the\nMessenger of Allah (SA):\nMuhammad! You are the Trustworthy, the Lord, and the Magnanimous Master,\nFor the noble, the best, the generous, and the pure in lineage.\nYou are the Most Auspicious of the fortunate surrounded by the luckiest.\nSince the time of Adam there has always been amongst us a divinely-guided successor.\nI have recognized you as the truthful in words that is not refuted.\nYou spoke the truth when you were but a beardless child. He (Abu Talib) says: \"You spoke\nwith knowledge as a child, even before anything was revealed to you. You were like\nAbraham (AS) who told his people as a youth: Surely I am clear of what you set up\n(with Allah); and like Jesus (AS) when he spoke from his cradle that Surely I am a\nservant of Allah; He has given me the Book and made me a prophet; and He has\nmade me blessed wherever I may be.

He\n(AS) says in it: The fair faced one for the sake of whom one prays for rain. He is a\nspring for the orphans, and a safeguard for the helpless.\nThe perishing children of Hashim circumambulate around him (to be his ransom),\nHence, they are in ease, and excess with him.\nHe is the Balance of Truth which does not break a promise, even for a grain of barley.\nAnd he is a Balance of Justice whose measurement does not go astray.",

Blessed and Exalted is He from having a son, a partner, an associate, or anything else the oppressors may claim of the Elevated, and Great. As we see in the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: Blessed is He who sent down the Furqan upon His Servant (Muhammad) that he may be a Warner to the nation. Verily, what is meant is that Allah's existence is everlasting, His bounties are endless, and His Remembrance is a blessing for His Servants. The continuation of Allah's blessings towards His Servants is that He sent them the Criterion as a Warner to the nations. The Furqan is the Quran and it has been certainly named the Furqan (the criterion), because Allah, the Mighty and High, differentiates by it between truth and falsehood. The servant upon whom He sent it down to is Muhammad (SA). He named him \"servant\" to prevent him from being taken as a Lord or Deity. This is a refutation of the exaggerators. The Mighty and High has clarified that He has revealed it to him so that he may warn with it the nations and frighten them by it from the disobedience of Allah and His Painful Chastisement. Al-alamun (the nations) are the people. He, whose is the kingdom of heaven and the Earth, and who did not take to Himself a son, as the Christians claim falsely by adding a son to Him, and deviating fro the belief in Diving Unity. And who has no associate in the kingdom, and who created everything, then ordained for it a measure, i.e. He created all things in a measure that He knows. He did not create anything negligently, carelessly, with trouble or by means of speculation. In fact, He created everything in just measure according to His Plan. He created everything according to the best interest of His Servants and their religion. This is a manifestation of His Justice towards His Creation. Had He not created the world in jut measure, on the basis of what we have described, then incongruity and injustice would have been found within it. His Creation would not have been made in wisdom and correct planning, and would have been subject to uselessness, injustice, and corruption. Allah, glory be Him, has always been All-Knowing of all things. Verily, He meant by His word: then ordained for it a measure that He carried it out based on a measurement He Knows (as we have explained) and to ordain His Actions for His Servants to make them recognize its measurement, its time, and where it will take place. This planning from Allah, the Mighty and High, is written and reported. Allah has notified His Angels and informed of it so that they may know it. Therefore, when His Words are found in measurement He introduces them so that they may not go out of the limits of truth to falseness, from the limits of correctness to incorrectness, and from the limits of clarity to deception This is an indication that Allah ordained it, made it firm, and brought it about. Thus, it is perfect. There is no flow, incongruity or corruption in it.",

Allah honors you by them.\" The Prophet (SA) enquired, \"What are they, O Jibra'il?\" He said: Say: O One who reveals beauty, and hides ugliness! O One who does not punish the offender, and who does not ear the veil (from sins)! O Most Great in pardoning! O Best of the Overlookers! O All-Embracing in Forgiveness! O One who Opens His Hands in Mercy! O Hearer of all Whispers! O One whom all complaints are made! (O Last Resort of the Fallen!). O Noble One! O Possessor of Great Favor! O One who Blessed before anyone deserves it! O our Lord! O our Master! O our Guardian! O Goal of our Desires! I beseech You, O Allah, not to make me ugly by means of the Fire. The Messenger of Allah (SA) asked, \"O Jibra'il! What are the virtues of these words?\" Jibra'il replied, So great! So great! The virtues of these words are impossible to describe. Even if the angels from the seven heavens and the seven earths joined together to describe the virtues of these words until the Day of Judgment, they would not be able to describe even a thousandth part of them. Therefore, when a man says: \"O One who reveals beauty, and hides ugliness,\" Allah covers him up with His Mercy in this world, and makes him beautiful in the Hereafter. Allah covers his defects with a thousand veils in this world, and the Hereafter. When he says: \"O One who does not punish the offender, and does not tear the veil (from sins),\" Allah will not hold him accountable on the Day of Judgment, and on the Day all Veils are Torn, He will not tear his veil.

When he says: \"O One who Opens His Hands in Mercy,\" Allah opens His Hands of Mercy to him. And when he says: \"O Hearer of all Whispers, O One to who all Complaints are made,\" Allah will bestow upon him the reward of every afflicted, unaffiliated, sick, blind, destitute, and poor person till the Day of Judgment.

And when he says: \"I beseech You, O Allah, not to make my being ugly by means of the Fire,\" the Supreme, may His glory be glorified, will say: My Servant has asked Me to free him from Fire. O My angels! Bear witness that I set him, his parents, his אחיו, his sisters, his household, his children, and his neighbors free from the Fire, and accepted his intercession for a thousand others who deserved punishment by fire, and saved them from it.

If His Knowledge is created then He, glorified be His Praise, was without knowledge before it creation. This is an imperfect attribute, and every imperfection is caused, as we explained previously. If His Knowledge is eternal, then it becomes necessary for other than Allah, the Mighty and High, to be eternal. This is infidelity by consensus. The same argument can be applied to the AllPowerful and His Omnipotence and the Ever-Living and His Life. The proof that He, the Exalted, has always been All-Powerful, All-Knowing and Ever-Living is that it has been proved that He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful, and Ever-Living, in and of Himself.

"Content": "The Compiler of this book explains: It has been mentioned in this book that the Qur'an is the Word of Allah, His Revelation, His Speech, and His Book. What has not been mentioned in this book is that it is created. We have indeed refrained from applying the word \"created\" to it, because the word \"created\" literally may mean \"made-up\". It is said: \"Created speech,\" i.e. made-up. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says: You only worship idols besides Allah and you create a lie, i.e. make up a lie. The Exalted has said regarding those who deny Divine Unity: We never heard of this in the former faith; this is nothing but a forgery, i.e. fabrication and a lie. Therefore, whoever believes that the Qur'an is created, in the meaning of being made-up, he has disbelieved. On the other hand, whoever says that it is not created, in the sense that it is not made-up, he is correct and has spoken the truth. Whoever believes that it is uncreated, in the sense that it is not accidental, not revealed, and unprotected, then he is mistaken and has said something false and inappropriate. It is the consensus of all Muslims that the Qur'an is not metaphorically the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High, but is literally the Word of Allah. Whoever says other than that, then he is in denial and falsehood. If we examine the Qur'an, we find it to be elaborate: Some parts are connected to others, some parts are disconnected, some verses come before others, for example, so abrogators come later than the abrogated. Even if with this description it is not accidental, then the evidence on the occurrence of the accidental beings would be void It would be impossible to prove the One that caused it to be finite, separated and joined. The other thing is that the intellect acknowledges that the Ummah has formed a consensus that Allah, the Mighty and High, is Truthful in His Communications. As is well-known, a lie is to communicate something which has not happened. Allah, the Mighty and High, cited the statement of the Pharoah: I am your lord, the most high. He cited Nuh (AS) when he called upon his son who did not want to join him: O my son! Embark with us and be not with the unbelievers. Thus, if these statements and communications were eternal, then they existed before the Pharoah, and before he said it; hence, they would not be informative. This is what a lie is. However, if these words were not said until the Pharoah said them, they are accidental, which means they came into existence from non-existence. The other point is that Allah, the Mighty and High, says: And if We please, We should certainly take away that which We have revealed to you. And His Word: Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. Whatever has a likeness and whatever can vanish after existence is accidental.",

"Content": "7. The confirmation of this is of this is what our Shaykh Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) has mentioned in his Jami; and said, on the authority of Muhammad ibn alHasan al-Saffar, on the authority of al-`Abbas ibn Marub that Abd al-Rahman ibn Abu Najran related to me, on the authority of Hammad ibn Uthman, on the authority of Abd al-Rahim alQasir that I wrote to Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) and sent it with Abd al-Malik ibn Ayun: May I be your ransom! I write to you regarding matters in which people have differed. If you seem it appropriate, may Allah take me as your ransom, then please answer me. The people of Iraq have differed regarding recognition and denial. May I be your ransom, are they created? They have also differed regarding the Qur'an. One group claims that the Qur'an is the uncreated Word of Allah, and the other group claims that it is the created Word of Allah. As regards ability, does it take place before the action or does it occur simultaneously along with the action? Our Companions have differed about it, all quoting traditions to support their views. As regards Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, can He be described by means of an image? If you deem it fitting, please respond to me in writing with the correct position regarding Divine Unity, whether motion is created or uncreated, and with the definition of faith. Hence, he (AS) wrote and sent it back with Abd al-Malik ibn Ayun: You asked about the nature of recognition. Then know, may Allay have mercy on you, that recognition was created by Allah, the Mighty and High, and placed in the heart of the created, and denial was created by Allah, and placed in the hearts of the created. The only control that servants have over these two is choice. Hence, if they yearn for faith, they recognize Allah, and become believers. However, if they yearn for infidelity, they deny Allah and become unbelievers who are led astray. Whoever embraces faith, Allah grants him success. And whoever rejects faith is forsaken by Allah. If Allah punishes or rewards them it is due to the choices they made. You asked, may Allah have mercy on you, about the dispute that people have concerning the Qur'an. They say that the Qur'an, is the Word of Allah, that it is accidental, that it is uncreated, and that it is not eternal alongside Allah, may His Remembrance be Exalted. Exalted is Allah, the Elevated, and the Great, from such things! Allah, the Mighty and high, existed when nothing other than Him was known or unknown. The Mighty and High existed when there was no speaker, no intender, no mover, and no doer. High and Mighty is our Lord. The Qur'an is the Word of Allah, and is not created. It contains information of those who came before you and those who will come after you. It was revealed by Allah to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, peace and salutations be upon him and his progeny. You also asked, may Allah have mercy on you, about the ability to act. Allah the Mighty and High, created the servant. He places in the servant the ability, the health, and the strength to act. Nothing moves without action. Movement and desire are qualities which Allah created and placed in human beings. Hence, when a human being desires something, he wishes it. It is for this reason that the human being is called \"the intender.\" If a human being intends to complete an action, he does so by means of ability and motion. It is for this reason that the servant is called \"the one with ability\" and \"the one who moves.\" Therefore, even when the human being is still, and does not wish to complete an action, he possesses the ability to act due to health, strength, and motion. Hence, stillness is an action: the action of refraining to act. Hence, it is said: \"the one that is still,\" is attributed with \"stillness.\" Therefore, when a human being desires to act, he does so by means of the strength which he posses. Hence, it is said that he is: \"the doer,\" \"the mover,\" \"the acquirer\" and \"the one who is able.\" Do you not see that these are all human attributes? You also asked, may Allah have mercy on you, about divine Unity and the views of your companions on that subject. Exalted is Allah, who has nothing whatsoever like unto Him. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Exalted is Allah from the descriptions of the anthropomorphist who compare Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, with His Creatures, attributing lies to Allah, the Mighty and High. Point out, may Allah have mercy on you, that the correct position regarding Divine Unity is to be found in the Attributes of Allah, the Mighty and High, which were revealed in the Qur'an. Do not apply annulment or anthropomorphism to Allah. He cannot be described by means of negation or anthropomorphism. Allah is the Firm, the Existent. Exalted is Allah from the descriptions of the describers. Do not stray from the Qur'an otherwise you will stray after clarity has reached you. You also asked, may Allah have mercy on you, about faith. Faith is confirmation with the tongue, agreement with the heart, and action with the limbs. Some parts of the faith are interconnected with the others. Sometimes a servant can be a Muslim before being faithful [mu'min], but he is never faithful until he is a Muslim. Therefore, Islam is before faith and it combines with the faith. Hence, when a servant commits a major or minor sin, which Allah the Mighty and High, has forbidden, then he leaves the circle of faith. He loses the title of faithful, while the tile of Islam remains with him. If he repents and seeks forgiveness, he returns to the status of faith, and if he does not return to disbelief and denial. If he says that the permissible is forbidden or that the forbidden is permissible, he leaves both the circle of faith and Islam, and enters into disbelief. He has the same rank as a man who enters the Holy Mosque in Mecca, enters the Ka'bah and the Holy Mosque. He is then killed, and goes straight to Hell.",

He replied: Allah is He in whom all take refuge in times of need and difficulty after having lost hope in all but Him, and after having broken relations from all but Him. A person says: In the name of Allah' i.e. I seek help in all my affairs from Allah, the Only One worthy of service. He is the Helper when help is sought. He is the Answerer when He is called upon. It is also what al-Sadiq (AS) said to an man when asked: \"O son of the Messenger of Allah! Those who debate with me have confused me. Guide me to Allah. What is He?\" Hence, he (AS) replied to him, \"O servant of Allah! Have you ever ridden a boat? The man said: \"Of course.\" The Imam (AS) responded, \"Then did it ever sink, leaving you without a boat to rescue you, and insufficient strength to swim? He answered, \"Yes.\" The Imam (AS) asked, \"At that moment, did you heart have faith in something. All-Powerful that could rescue you from your difficult situation?\" Thus, the man replied, \"Certainly.\" Al-Sadiq (AS) said: \"Then that thing is Allah, the All-Powerful, the One who Rescues when there is no rescuer, and the One who helps when no help is available.\" Al-Sadiq (AS) then added, Sometimes, some our Shiites forget to begin their action with \"In the Name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.\" As a result, He tries them with mishaps to caution them to be grateful to Him, the Blessed and Exalted, so that they may praise Him, and so that they may learn that it is a mistake to leave out the statement \"In the Name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. Al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Muhammad (AS) further said: \"A man stood up before Ali ibn al-Husayn (AS) and asked, \"Inform me about the meaning of In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.\" Consequently, Ali ibn al-Husayn (AS) replied, My father related to me, on the authority of his brother, al-Hasan, on the authority of his father, the Commander of the Faithful (AS) that a man stood before him and asked: \"O Commander of the Faithful, inform me about the meaning of In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.'\" Thus, he (AS) responded, \"Verily, the word Allah' is the greatest of the names of Allah, the Mighty and High. It is a name that cannot be given to other than Allah. Creatures are not named by it.\" At that time a man enquired that what is the explanation of the word \"Allah?\" The Commander of the Faithful (AS) explained, Allah is He in whom all take refuge in times of need and difficulty, after having lost hope in all other but Him, and after breaking ties with all other than Him. Regardless of how great, powerful, and wealthy a leader may be in this world, and regardless of how much others depend on him, there will always be things over which they leader has no power. Likewise, the leader himself may have needs that he cannot fulfill. Hence, in moments of need, he breaks away from all others, and turns towards Allah until his problem is resolved. And then he returns to his previous infidelity. Do you not hear the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: Say: Tell me if the chastisement of Allah should overtake you or the hour should come upon you, will you call (on others) besides Allah, if you are truthful? Nay, Him you call upon, so He clears away that for which you pray if He pleases and you forget what you set up (with Him). Hence, Allah, the Mighty and High, says to His Servants: O those in need of My Mercy, I have indeed compelled you to turn to Me for all your needs, and at all times, in complete submission. Therefore, rush towards Me for mercy in every endeavor you seek to commence, and which you seek to complete. Verily, if I intend to give you something, no one has the power to prevent Me. And If I intend to deny you something, no one has the power to give it to you. I am the Most Worthy of your supplications, and the Most Worthy of your implorations. Therefore, say at the commencement of every action, both small and big: \"In the Name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful\" [Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim], i.e. I seek help in this matter from Allah, the Sole Worthy of Service. He is the Helper when help is sought. He is the Answerer when He is called upon. He is the Most Compassionate, the Provider of sustenance. He is the Most Merciful in this world and the Hereafter. He made this religion easy and simple for us. He has shown mercy towards us by distinguishing us from His Enemies. He (AS) then added, The Messenger of Allah (AS) said: Whoever is distressed in pursuit of any activity and says: \"In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful,\" sincerely, embracing it in his heart, then one of two outcomes will take place: either his wish will be fulfilled in this world, or it will be granted to him by His Lord in the next world.

When someone is hit over the head so hard that he loses the ability to speak properly, the law decrees that he must be presented the letters of the alphabet. The extent of the compensation the culprit must pay is based on the number of letters of the alphabet which the victim of the assault cannot pronounce. My father related to me, on the authority of his father, on the authority of his grandfather, on the authority of the Commander of the Faithful (AS) that he said about the alphabet: The Letter * [alif] \"a\" * stands for Allah's Blessings [ala]; the letter * [ba] \"b\" stands for Allah's Joy [bahjat] (also for the Ever-Remaining and the Originator of the Heavens and the Earth); the letter * [ta] \"t\" stands for the completion of the affairs through the Rise from the Progeny of Muhammad (SA); the letter * [tha] \"th\" stands for the reward [thawab] for the good deeds of the believers. The letter * [jim] \"j\" stands for Allah's Exaltation [jamal] and Glory [jalal]; the letter * [ha] \"h\" stands for Allah's Forbearance [hilm] towards sinners (it also stands for the Ever-Living, the Truth, and the Forbearing); the letter * [kha] \"kh\" stands for the sluggishness of the disobedient ones in the presence of Allah, the Mighty and High. The letter * [dal] \"d\" stands for Allah's Religion [din] (which He has approved for His servants); and the letter * [dhal] \"dh\" stands for the Lord of Glory and Honor [dhil jalal wa-al-ikram]. The letter * [ra] \"r\" stands for the Affectionate [al-Ra'uf] and the Most Merciful [al-Rahim]; and the letter * [za] \"z\" stands for Shaking on the Day of Judgment. The Letter * [sin] \"s\" stands for Allah's Luminance [sana] (and His Eternity); and the letter * [shin] \"sh\" stands for Allah's Wish, whatever He wished and Intention, whatever He intended. And you do not wish except that Allah wishes. The letter * [sad] \"s\" stands for the One whose Promise is True [Sadiq al-Wad] in carrying the people over the Bridge [Sirat], and imprisoning the oppressors in the Hell; and the letter * [dad] \"d\" stands for the loss [dil] of whoever opposes Muhammad (SA) and his Progeny (AS). The letter * [ta] \"t\" stands for the Prosperity [tuba] and Good Ending for the Believes; and the letter * [za] z' stands for the optimism of the Believers about Allah and the pessimism of the unbelievers in Allah. The letter * [ayn] \"a\" stands for the Omniscient [Alim]; and the letter * [ghayn] \"gh\" stands for the Self-Sufficient [al-Ghani], who is absolutely never in need. The letter * [fa] \"f\" stands for the (the Splitter [al-Faliq] of the seeds and fruit kernels, and for) flame from the flames of the Fire; and the letter * [qaf] \"q\" stands for the Qur'an whose compilation and recitation depends upon Allah. Ther letter * [kaf] \"k\" stands for 242 the Sufficient [al-Kafi]; and the letter * [lam] \"l\" stands for the absurdity [laghw] of the unbelievers in the lies which they ascribe to Allah. The letter * [mim] \"m\" stands for the Sovereignty of Allah on the Day of Judgment, on the Day on which there will be no other sovereignty. Allah, the Mighty and High, says: To whom belongs the Kingdom this Day? At that time the spirits of His Prophets, Messengers and Proofs (AS) will speak and say: To Allah, the One, the Subduer (of All). Thus, Great be His Glory will respond: This Day every soul shall be rewarded for what it has earned; no injustice (shall be done) this day; surely Allah is quick in reckoning. And the letter * [nun] \"n\" stands for Allah's favour [nawal] for the believes and His Punishment [nakal] for the unbelievers. The letter * [wa'u] \"w\" stands for the affliction [wayl] with the punishment of the Day of Judgment for the ones who disobey Allah; and the letter * [ha'] \"h\" stands for the insignificance of those who disobey Allah. The letter * [la] \"la\" as in [la ilaha illa Allah] \"there is no god but Allah,\" is the expression of sincere devotion. There is no servant who says it sincerely except Paradise becomes incumbent upon him. Finally the letter * [ya] \"y\" stands for Allah's hand which is expanded over all His creatures for sustenance. Glorified and Exalted is He from what the polytheists profess.

The letter * [jim] \"j\" stands for \"high is His praise, and sacred are His Names;\" The letter * [ha] \"h\" stands for \"the Truth [haqq], the Ever-Living [hai], and he Forbearing [halim];\" The letter * [kha] \"kh\" stands for \"the All-Informed of what the servants to;\" The letter * [dal] \"d\" stands for \"the Rewarder of the Day of Judgment.\" And the letter * [dhal] \"dh\" stands for \"the Lord of glory and Honor\" [dhul jalal wa-alikram]. The letter * [ra] \"r\" stands for \"the Affectionate towards His Servants;\" And the letter * [za] \"z\" stands for \"the Beauty of the worshipped.\" The letter * [sin] \"s\" stands for \"the All-Hearing and All-Seeing;\" The letter * [shin] \"sh\" stands for \"the Thankful to His Believing Servants;\" The letter * [sad] \"s\" stands for \"the Most Truthful in His Promise [wad] and threat [waid];\" And the letter * [dhad] \"d\" stands for \"the Punisher [dar] and the Beneficial.\" The letter * [ta] \"t\" stands for \"the Pune [Tahir] and the One who Purifies;\" The letter * [za] \"z\" stands for \"the Manifested and the One that Manifests His Signs;\" The letter * [ayn] \"\" stands for \"the All-Knowing of His Servants;\" 244 And the letter * [ghayn] \"gh\" stands for \"the Aid of all those from His Creation who seek help.\" The letter * [fa] \"f\" stands for \"the Splitter of the seeds and fruit kernels;\" The letter * [qaf] \"q\" stands for \"the All-Powerful over all of His Creation;\" The letter * [kaf] \"k\" stands for \"the Sufficient who there is non like unto Him and He begets not, nor is He begotten;\" The letter * [lam] \"l\" stand for \"the Kind over His servants;\" The letter * [mim] \"m\" stands for \"the Master of sovereignty;\" The letter * [nun] \"n\" stands for \"the light of heavens from the Light of His Throne;\" The letter * [wa'u] \"w\" stands for \"the One [Wahid], the Uique and the Needless, who begets not, nor is He begotten;\" The letter * [ha] \"h\" stands for \"the guide for His Creation;\" The letter * [la] \"la\" stands for \"there is no god but Allah;\" And finally the letter * [ya] stands for Allah's Hand which Extends over all His Creatures.\" Then the Messenger of Allah (SA) responded, \"Allah, the Mighty and High, is pleased with this answer.\" Consequently, the Jewish man accepted Islam.",

When he turned seven months old, his mother took him to the teachers of script. She placed him before the teacher, so the teacher said to him: \"Say: In the Name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.\" Thus, Isa (AS) said: \"In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.\" Then the teacher said to him: \"Say: Abjad (the alphabet).\" So Isa (AS) lifted his head and asked, \"Do you know what abjad is?\" Hence, the teacher picked up a lash to hit him. Therefore, Isa (AS) responded, \"O teacher, do not hit me.

Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: Muhammad ibn al-Hasan alSafar said: Muhammad ibn al-Husayn ibn Abu al-Khattab; and Ahmad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Fuddal said, on the authority of Ali ibn Asbat, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Zayd that Muhammad ibn Salim related to me, on the authority of Asbagh ibn Nubatah that . The Commander of the Faithful said: Uthman ibn Affan asked the Messenger of Allah (SA) about the explanation of the alphabet according to their numerical value. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah (SA) responded, \"Learn the explanation of the alphabet according to its numerical value, for verily, it contains wonders. Shame on the learned who ignore its meaning.\" Hence, it was asked: \"What is the explanation of the alphabet?\" Then he (SA) explained, As for the letter [alif], it stands for the Blessings of Allah. It is a letter from the letters of His Names. The letter [ba] stands for Allah's Joy; The letter [jim] stands for Allah's Paradise, His Glory and Exaltation; The letter [dal] sands for Allah's Religion. As for hawwaz, then the letter [ha] stands for the burning abyss, so affliction is for the ones who are cast in Hell; The letter [wa'u] stands for the affliction for the ones in the Fire; And the letter [zai] stands for a corner of Hell, thus, we seek refuge in Allah from what is in the corner. As for Hutti, then the letter [ha] is for the diminishing of the mistakes from the seekers of forgiveness in the Night of Power [laylat al-qadr], and what Jibra'il brings down with the angels till the break of the morning; The letter [ta] stands for the Prosperity [tuba], the good End for the believers. It [tuba] is a tree which Allah, the Mighty and High, has planted, and in which He has breathed His Spirit. Verily, its branches are noticeable from behind the enclosure of Paradise. It brings forth pieces of jewellery and drinks ready to fall down unto their mouths; The letter [ya] stands for Allah's Hand which is expanded over all His Creatures. Glorified and Exalted is He, opposed to what the polytheists profess. As for Kaliman, then the letter [kaf] stands for Allah's Word, \"there is none who can alter His Words; and you shall not find any refuge besides Him.\" The letter [lam] stands for the acquaintance [ilmam] of the ones in Paradise with each other in meeting, greeting and salutations, and gathering [talawum] of the ones in Hell with what they have between themselves. The letter [mim] stands for the Sovereignty of Allah, which never declines and the Endlessness of Allah, which never perishes. The letter [nun] stands for \"Nun. I swear by the Pen and what they (the Angels) write.\" Hence, the pen is from light and the book is from light in the guarded tablet, which the close ones witness and Allah suffices as a witness. As for Safas, then it is tit for tat and precious stone for a precious stone, i.e. recompense for recompense and as you sow so shall you reap. Verily, Allah does not intend oppression for the servants. As for Qarashat, it means that Allah assembles them, then resurrects them, and revives them on the Day of Judgment. He then judges them with righteousness, and they shall not be oppressed in the least.",

"Content": "Chapter Thirty-Four: Tafsir Huruf al-Adhan wa al-Iqamat. The Explanation of the Words of the Calls to Prayer - 2 traditions 1. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Marwazi al-Hakim al-Muqri' said: Abu Amr Muhammad ibn jafar al-Muqri' al-Jurjani said: Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Musili said in Baghdada that Muhammad ibn Asim al-Tarifi said: Abu Zayd Ayyash ibn Yazid ibn al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kahhal freed slave of Zayd ibn Ali said: My father Yazid ibn al-Hasan related tome that Musa ibn Jafar related to me on the authority of his father Jafar ibn Muhammad, on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn Ali, on the authority of his father Ai ibn al-Husayn that his father 249 > > o n Al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) said: We were sitting in the Mosque when the muezzin [al-mu'dhdhin] went to the minaret and said: \"Allah is the Greatest\" [Allahu Akbar] twice. The Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) started to weep, which caused us to weep as well. Therefore, when the muezzin finished, Ali (AS) asked, \"Do you know the inner meaning of the call to prayer made by the muezzin?\" We all replied, \"All, His Messenger (SA), and His Successor, know best.\" So he (AS) explained, If you knew the meaning of the words of the call to prayer, you would laugh little and weep much. The statement \"Allah is the Greatest\" has many meanings. When the muezzin says \"Allah is Greatest\" it refers to His Eternity, His Sempiternity, His Infinity, His Knowledge, His Power, His Omnipotence, His Forbearance, His Munificence, His Generosity, His Bounty, and His Pride. When the muezzin says \"Allah is the Greatest\" he proclaims that the Creation and the Command belong to Allah. He proclaims that creation came about as a result of His Will. He proclaims that creation comes from Him, and will return to Him. He proclaims that He is the First of the First as He has always existed, and that He is the Last of the Last as He will always exit. He proclaims that He is the Manifest, who cannot be perceived, and that He is the Hidden, who is not subject to limitations of any sort. He proclaims that He is the Ever-Lasting, and that everything but Him will perish. The second meaning of \"Allah is the Greatest\" refers to the fact that He is All-Knowing, the All-Informed, who knows everything that has occurred and everything that will occur, even before it occurs. The third meaning of \"Allah is the Greatest\" is that He is All-Powerful over everything. His Power extends over everything. He is Powerful due to His Power, and the Potent One over His Creation. He is Powerful in Essence. His Power embraces all things. When He decrees a thing, He only says to it, \"Be\", and it is. The fourth \"Allah is the Greatest\" refers to His Forbearance and Generosity. He forbears as if He were unaware of the sin, pardons as if He did no see the sin, and covers with mercy as if He had not been disobeyed. He does not hasten punishment out of His Generosity, Forgiveness, and Forbearance. Another meaning of \"Allah is the Greatest\" is that He is Generous, Ample-Giving, and the Most Munificent. The other meaning of \"Allah is the Greatest\" is to negate His Shape, and that Allah is Greater than any of His Attributes. Verily, those who describe Allah describe him on the basis of their own ability and not according to His Might and Majesty. Exalted is Allah, the Elevated, the Great, from what the attributers perceive as His Attributes. Another meaning of \"Allah is the Greatest\" refers to the fact that Allah is the Most High and Exalted. He is Self-Sufficient from His Servants. He is not in need of the deeds of His Creation. As for his statement: \"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah\" [ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah], it declares that no profession of faith is permissible unless it comes sincerely from the heart. A sincere profession of faith is recognition that there is no one worthy of service but Allah, the Mighty and High, and refusing to serve other than Allah, the Mighty and High. My tongue confesses to my heart's belief that there is no god but Allah. And I bear witness that there is no refuge from Allah except through Allah. And that there is no security from the evil of all evil doers and from the mischief of all mischief mongers, except with Allah. The second time that \"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah\" is proclaimed, it means: I bear witness there is no guide except Allah, and that there is no Guide but Allah. I bear witness to Allah that there is no god but Allah. And I call upon all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, including angels and human beings; and I call upon the mountains, the trees, the animals that are mounted, and the animals which are wild, and all that is wet and dry, that there is no Creator but Allah, and that there is no Sustainer, no One served, no Punisher, no Helper, no Seizer of Souls, no Extender, no Provider, no Preventer, no Defender, no Admonisher, no Sufficient, n o Cure, no Preceder, and no Final Destination except 252 Allah. To Him belongs the Creation and the Command. In His Hand is all goodness. Blessed be Allah, the Lord of the Worlds! As for his statement: \"I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\" [ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasul Allah], it proclaims that: I bear witness to Allah that there is no god but Him, and that Muhammad (SA) is His Servant, Messenger, and Prophet, as well as the Sincere Bearer of His Secret. He sent him to all mankind with guidance, with the Religion of Truth and He might make it prevail over all other religions, no matter how much the polytheists may detest it. I bear witness to whoever is in the heaves and the earth, to the Prophets, Messengers, angels, and all mankind, that Muhammad (SA) is the Master of the First and the Last. The second time \"I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah\" is proclaimed, it means: I bear witness no one is in need of anyone but Allah, the One, the Dominant. Everything is in need of Him. Glory be to Him! He is Self-Sufficient from His Servants and all of creation. And I bear witness that He sent Muhammad (SA) to all people as a Bearer of Glad Tidings, as a Warner who invites to Allah by His Permission, and as a Light-Giving Torch. Therefore, whoever denies him, rejects him, and does not believe in him. Allah, the Mighty and High, will cast him in the Hell-fire forever and ever, and he shall never leave it. As for the statement: \"Hasten to the prayer\" [hayya ala al-salah], i.e. come to the best of your deeds, and the invitation of your Lord it means: Hasten to the forgiveness of your Lord, who will free you from the burden of the Fire which you bear on your backs. Hasten to free yourselves from enslavement to sin, so that Allah may pardon you your wrongdoings, forgive you your sins, and replace your bad deeds with good deeds, since He is the Sovereign, the Generous, the Possessor of Excellence, and the Most Great. He has granted us, the Muslims, permission to enter into His service, and granted us precedence in entering into His Presence. The second time \"hasten to the prayer\" is said, i.e. rise up to communicate your needs to your Lord, it means: Seek access to Him through His Words, intercede with Him, and increase the mention of His Name, supplication, bowing down, prostration, submission, and humbleness. Elevate your needs before Him, for He has permitted us to do so. As for his statement `Hasten to the success\" [hayya al al-falah] it means: Come to eternity where there is no death, come to salvation from disaster; come to life without death, to comfort without exhaustion, to sovereignty that does not decline, to joy without grief, to sociability without loneliness, to light without darkness, to affluence without tightness, to joy without end, to gratification without desire, to health without illness, to dignity without humility, to strength without weakness, and to the greatest of honor. Hasten to the joy of this world and the Hereafter by attaining salvation in this world for the Hereafter. The second time that \"hasten to the success\" is said it means: Compete in what I have called you to; vie for ample generosity, great kindness, splendid bounty, great success, and everlasting comfort in the proximity of Muhammad (SA) in a seat of truth before a Powerful King. As for his statement: \"Allah is the Greatest\" [Allahu Akbar] it means: Allah's Kindness towards His Creation is grater than anyone can possibly conceive. It refers to His Kindness towards His Servants through answering their prayers; His Kindness towards His Servants who obey Him, and who obey His Legal guardians; His Kindness towards His Servant who serves Him, who preoccupies himself with Him and His Remembrance, who loves Him, and who befriends Him; His Kindness towards Hi servant who find tranquility in Him, who trust Him, who fears Him, who puts his hope in Him, who yearns for Him, who accepts His Commands and decrees, and who is please with Him. The second time that \"Allah is the Greatest\" is said it means: Allah's Kindness towards His Creation is so great that it cannot possibly be conceived. It refers to His Kindness towards His Friends, His Punishment of His Enemies, the extent of His Pardoning, His Forgiveness, and His Bounty towards those who answer His Call, and the Call of His Messenger. It also refers to the extent of His Punishment and His Humiliation of those who deny Him and who reject Him. As for the statement: \"There is no got but Allah\" [la ilaha illa Allah] it means: Allah is the conclusive argument humankind via His Messengers, His Message, His Clarification, and His Invitation. He is far above any argument against Him. Therefore, whosoever answers His Call, then for him is both light and kindness. And whosoever denies Him, then verily, Allah is Self-Sufficient from the Worlds, and He is the Swiftest in Taking Account. The meaning of \"the prayer has begun\" [qad qamat al-salah] in the Call to Prayer [iqamah] is: Now is the time for visiting, supplication, fulfilling needs, achieving wishes, and seeking Allah, the Mighty and High, as well as His Kindness, His Forgiveness, His Pardon, and His Pleasure.\" The Compiler of this book says: Verily, the narrator of this tradition avoided mentioning \"Hasten to the best of deeds\" [hayya ala khayr al-Amal] due to dissimulation [taqiyyah].",

Therefore, he (AS) explained: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, leads astray the oppressors on the Day of Judgment from the abode of His Kindness, and guides the Faithful ones and the ones with good deeds, to Paradis, as He, the Mighty and High, says: And Allah causes the unjust to go astray, and Allah does what He pleases. The Mighty and High says: Surely (as for) those who believe and do good, their Lord will guide them by their faith; there shall flow from beneath them rivers in gardens of bliss. He says: I asked, \"What about the Word of Mighty and High: And with none but Allah is the direction of my affair to a right issue, and His Word, the Mighty and High: If Allah assist you, then there is none that can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there then that can assist you after Him? Thus, he (AS) replied: If a servant carried out what Allah, the Mighty and High, commands him to do in terms of obedience, then his action would be in accordance with the Command of Allah, the Mighty and High, and the servants will be directed. However, if a servant intends to disobey Allah, then Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, obstructs him from that disobedience, refraining him from it. If the servant was refrained from disobedience it was due to Allah's guidance, Exalted be His Remembrance. Whenever He leaves him to disobedience, and does not present him from disobedience, then Allah has forsaken him, and decided not to guide him and assist him.",

"Content": "Chapter Thirty-Six: Al-Radd ala al-Thanawiyyah wa-al-Zanadiqah. The Refutation of the Dualists & the Atheists - 6 traditions 1. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (may Allah have mercy on them_ said: Abu al-Qasim al-Alawi said: Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Barmaki said: al-Husayn ibn al-Hasan said: Ibrahim ibn Hashim al-Qummi related to me that al-Abbas ibn Amr al-Fuqaymi said: on the authority of Hisham ibn al-Hakam that > 258 259 A dualist came to Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS). Among the things Abu Abd Allah (AS) said to him was: If you claim that \"there is two (gods)\" there can only be three possibilities. One: that both gods are eternal and all-powerful. Two: that both gods are weak. Or three: that on of them is all-powerful, and the other one is weak. Now, if both of them are powerful, then why doesn't one of them overthrow the other, and mange all affairs single-handedly? If you believe that one of them is powerful, and the other one weak, then you have proved that He is One, and to the apparent inability of the second. And if you say that \"they are two,\" then only two things are possible: one, that they are both united in all aspects; or two, that they are separate in all aspects. However, when we contemplate the organization in creation, the orbits of the planets in the celestial sphere, the variation of day and night, the sun and the moon, and how everything operate in harmony, everything points that he Manager is One. Furthermore, if you claim that there are two gods, there must be a division between them both which has always existed, and that division would have to be a third god. However, if your claim that there are three gods, then there must be two divisions between them, leaving us with fie gods, and so on add aeterum. Hisham said: The dualist then questioned him until he asked, \"What is the proof of His Existence?\" Abu Abd Allah (AS) replied, \"The existence of great wonders is proof that they were created by the Creator. When you see the imposing structure of building, you know instinctively that it was built by someone, even though you did not see him build it. He enquired, \"What is He?\" The Imam (AS) explained, He is a thing unlike other things. Consider the word \"a thing\" in order to understand its implication. Since He is Real, and He Exists, He is indeed a Thing. However, He is devoid of both body and image. He is neither sensed nor felt, nor is He perceived by the five senses. The imagination perceives Him not. He is not subject to time. Time has no effect upon Him. The questioner asked, \"Therefore, you are saying that Verily, He is All-Hearing, and All-Seeing?\" The Imam (AS) responded, He is All-Hearing, and All-Seeing. He is All-Hearing without tools, and All-Seeing, without instruments. In fact, He hears by means of His entire being and He hears by His entire being. My statement does not mean that \"He hears by means of His Entire Being\" in the sense that He is something, and His Being is something else. I am simply using this example in order to answer your question. I say: \"He hears by means of His Entire Being\" and not in the sense that He has parts. Rather, I am attempting to make myself understood. My only other option would be to say that He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing, AllKnowing, and All-Informed, in His Very Essence. The questioner questioned, \"Than what is He?\" Abu Abd Allah (AS) answered, He is the Lord. He is the Worshipped One, He is Allah. When I use the word \"Allah,\" I am not referring to the combination of the letters \"a,\" \"l,\" and \"h\". Rather, I am pointing to its meaning. He is a thing that is the Creator of all Things, and their Manufacturer who is described by means of these letters. He is the one who is referred to by the names Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful, the Honorable, among other names. He is the Worshipped One, the High and mighty. The questioner enquired, \"So anything we can conceive of it created?\" Abu Abd Allah (AS) replied: If things were as you claimed, then recognizing Divine Unity would be beyond our reach. We are not obliged to believe in what cannot be imagined. However, we say: everything we can conceive with our senses is perceived. Therefore, whatever the sense can discover and demonstrate is created. In order to prove the existence of the Creator of All Things, we must do so without recurring to two erroneous approaches: the first of which is negation, i.e. abolition [ibtal], and non-existence [adam]; and the second is anthropomorphism, i.e. description, composition [tarkib], and formation [ta'lif]. We cannot prove the existence of the Creator on the basis of these two approaches as they are created, The Creator is not like the created. If He resembles the created, then whatever applies to the created would also apply to Him: such as coming into existence after non-existence, growth, change of color, change of strength, and so forth. The questioner said: \"In attempting to prove His Existence, you have limited Him.\" Abu Abd Allah (AS) responded, \"I have not limited Him. ON the contrary, I have demonstrated His Existence through the only means possible: assertion and negation.\" The questioner said: \"Is His Existence real and actual?\" The Imam (AS) replied, \"Yes, His Existence is Real as nothing can be prove without being real and actual.\" The questioner asked, \"Does He have a shape?\" The Imam (AS) explained, No, because shape is description that delineates. We must move away from negation and anthropomorphism Whoever negates Him, denies Him, eliminates His Lordship, and abolished Him. Whoever compares Him with other things describes Him on the basis of created attributes which are not worthy of Him. Nevertheless, we must prove His Essence without referring to shape. None is worthy of His Essence besides Him. And no one shares His Essence, encompasses it, or knows it but Him. The questioner said: \"Does He sustain all things by Himself?\" Abu Abd Allah (AS) answered, \"He is far Greater than sustaining things directly as only crated being s bring things forth directly. Exalted is He! His Intent and His Will are effective. He is the Mighty Doer of whatever He wills.\" The questioner enquired, \"Does He feel pleasure or anger?\" Abu Abd Allah (AS) said: Yes. However, His Pleasure and His Anger differ from the pleasure and anger fund among crated beings. Among created beings, pleasure and anger cause a change of state which is an attribute of the created, the incapable, and the needy. He is the Blessed and Exalted, the Honorable, and the Most Merciful. He is not in need of His Creation, while all His Creation is in need of Him. Verily, He created all things by means of in",

We cannot prove the existence\nof the Creator on the basis of these two approaches as they are created, The Creator is\nnot like the created. If He resembles the created, then whatever applies to the created\nwould also apply to Him: such as coming into existence after non-existence, growth,\nchange of color, change of strength, and so forth.\nThe questioner said: \"In attempting to prove His Existence, you have limited Him.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) responded, \"I have not limited Him. ON the contrary, I have\ndemonstrated His Existence through the only means possible: assertion and negation.\"\nThe questioner said: \"Is His Existence real and actual?\"\nThe Imam (AS) replied, \"Yes, His Existence is Real as nothing can be prove without\nbeing real and actual.\"\nThe questioner asked, \"Does He have a shape?\"\nThe Imam (AS) explained,\nNo, because shape is description that delineates. We must move away from negation\nand anthropomorphism Whoever negates Him, denies Him, eliminates His Lordship,\nand abolished Him. Whoever compares Him with other things describes Him on the\nbasis of created attributes which are not worthy of Him. Nevertheless, we must prove\nHis Essence without referring to shape. None is worthy of His Essence besides Him.\nAnd no one shares His Essence, encompasses it, or knows it but Him.\nThe questioner said: \"Does He sustain all things by Himself?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) answered, \"He is far Greater than sustaining things directly as only\ncrated being s bring things forth directly. Exalted is He! His Intent and His Will are\neffective. He is the Mighty Doer of whatever He wills.\"\nThe questioner enquired, \"Does He feel pleasure or anger?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said:\nYes. However, His Pleasure and His Anger differ from the pleasure and anger fund\namong crated beings. Among created beings, pleasure and anger cause a change of\nstate which is an attribute of the created, the incapable, and the needy. He is the\nBlessed and Exalted, the Honorable, and the Most Merciful. He is not in need of His\nCreation, while all His Creation is in need of Him. Verily, He created all things by means\nof invention and innovation, without any need or cause.\nThe questioner uttered, \"Then what about His Word: The Most Compassionate is firm\non the Empyrean.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) replied,\nHe described Himself as such in order to convey that He is the Possessor of the\nEmpyrean, not in the sense that the Empyrean carries the Empyrean and restrains it.\nAnd we say this because His has said: His Throne extends over the heavens and the\nearth. Therefore, we say of the Empyrean and the Throne what He has said: and we\nrefute the notion that the Empyrean or the Throne contains Him as He is not in need\nof space or anything which He has created. On the contrary, He has created them and\nthey are in need of Him.\nThe questioner said: \"Then what is the difference between raising your hands to\nheaven and lowering them towards the earth?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) answered,\nThat makes no difference in His Knowledge, Encompassment, and Omnipotence, but\nHe, the Mighty and High, commanded His Beloved Ones and His Servants to raise their\nhands to heaven towards the Empyrean because He made it a so0urce of sustenance.\nThis is proved from the Qur'an. It is also proved from the tradition of the Messenger\n(SA) which says: \"Raise your hands to Allah the Mighty and High.\" And this is agreed\nupon between all the schools of thought in the Ummah.\nThe questioner asked, \"How can you prove that Allah sent Prophets and messengers?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) explained,\nVerily, we have proved that we have a Creator and a Producer who is Exalted from His\nCreation, and that he Producer is the Most Wise. It is impossible for His Creation to see\nHim or touch Him. He does not contact His Creation directly nor does His Creation\ncontact Him directly. He does not reason with them, and they do not reason with Him.\nThus, this proves that He has Representatives and Servants in His Creations who guide\nhumanity towards what is best for them. They shall be granted e3ternitiy if they accept\nguidance. And they shall face destruction if they reject guidance. Evidently, those who\npromote the good and forbid the evil in His Creation must have been sent by the Most\nWise, the All-Knowing.\nThis demonstrates that He has Interpreters, and they are the Prophets, the Cream of His\nCreation, who are men of wisdom whom He has sent to guide and educate humankind.\nThey are human in shape, but not in nature. They are endorsed by Allah, the Most Wise,\nthe Omniscient, with wisdom, signs, proofs, and evidence, like giving life to the dead,\nhealing lepers, and restoring sight to the blind. Verily, Allah's earth is never without a\nProof [hujjat] (of Allah) who brings the teachings of the Messenger (AS) and who\nembodies justice.",

    "Content": "3. Muhammad ibn Ali Majilwayh (RA) said, on the authority of his paternal uncle Muhammad\nibn Abu al-Qasim that Abu Saminah Muhammad ibn Ali al-Sayrafi related to me, on the\nauthority of Muhammad ibn Abd Allah al-Khursasani the servant of al-Rida (AS) that\nAn atheist entered the presence of al-Rida (AS) when he had some people in his\npresence.\nTherefore, Abu al-Hasan al-Rida (AS) asked him, \"O man! Can you not see that if your\nview is correct, and it is absolutely not, then we are equal despite our prayers, fasting,\nalms-giving, and tht beliefs we profess have not harmed us?\"\nThe atheist remained silent.\nThen Abu al-Hasan (AS) added, \"However, if our view is the correct one, which is\ncertainly the case, then you are lost, and we are saved.\"\nThe man said: \"May Allah's mercy be upon you! Can you describe to me how He is and\nwhere He is?\"\nThe Imam (AS) answered,\nWoe to you! Verily, you are misguided. He originated the \"where\" since He existed\nwhen there was no \"where.\" He originated the \"how\" since He existed when there\nwas no \"how.\" He cannot be described in terms of \"how\" or \"where,\" nor can he be\nperceived by any of our senses, or gauged by any other means.\nThe man said: \"Then surely He is nothing if He cannot be perceived by any of the\nsense.\"\nAbu al-Hasan (as) said: Woe to you! Will you deny His Lordship simply because your\nsense cannot perceive Him? Although our senses fail to perceive Him, we know for\ncertain that He is our Lord despite arguments to the contrary.\"\nThe man said: \"Then tell, since when has He existed?\"\nAbu al-Hasan said: \"If you can tell me when He did no exist, I can tell you when He did\nexist.\"\nThe man said: \"Then how can we prove His Existence?\"\nAbu al-Hasan (AS) replied,\nVerily, when I contemplate my body and see that it is impossible for me to increase or\ndecrease its breadth and height, to keep unpleasant things away from it, or draw\nbenefits to it, then I know that this structure has a Maker. I acknowledge His Existence\non the basis of the planets which orbit in the celestial sphere by His Command. I\nacknowledge His Existence on the basis of the production of clouds in the sky. I\nacknowledge His Existence on the basis of the movement of the winds. I acknowledge\nHis Existence on the basis of the movement of the sun, the moon, and the starts. When\nI consider all the wonders of creation, I know that they are the product of a Determiner\n[Muqaddir], and an Originator [Munshi'].\nThe man enquired, \"Then why has He veiled Himself (from men) ?\"\nAbu al-Hasan (AS) responded, \"Verily, the veil between Allah and His Creatures is the\nresult of their sins. As for Him, no secret is hidden from Him whether day or night.\"\nThe man said: \"Then why does the sense of sight not perceive Him?\"\nThe Imam (AS) answered, \"Vision seized Him not because He differs from His Creatures\nwho see and are seeing. He is far above being seeing by sight, encompassed by the\nimagination, or conceived through reasoning.\"\nThe man said: \"Then define His Limits for me.\"\nThe Imam (AS) answered, \"He has no limits.\"\nThe man asked, \"Why?\"\nThe Imam (AS) answered,\nHe has no limits, because every limited thing has an end to its limits. If something can\nbe limited, it can also be extended. If something can be extended, it can also be\ncontracted. However, He is Unlimited. He is neither extended nor is He constrained. He\ncannot be divided, nor can He be imagined.\nThe man said: \"Then tell me about your saying that: \"He is Subtle, All-Hearing, AllSeeing, All-Knowing and All-Wise.' Can He be All-Hearing without ears, All Seeing\nwithout eyes, Subtle without hands, and Most Wise without workmanship?\"\nAbu al-Hasan (AS) replied,\nVerily, a person among us is judge to be subtle on the basis of his workmanship. Have\nyou not seen a man who undertakes a task, and is subtle in his handling of it, so it is\nsaid: \"How subtle is so and so!\" Then how could it not be said that the Majestic Creator\nis not Subtle when He creates a subtle and majestic creation, places souls in the living,\nand creates diversity among species, so that none of them is identical to the other?\nEvery creature He has made contains subtle differences as a sign for the Subtle, AllAware, Creator.\nWhen we look upon the trees, and the delicate fruits they bear, both edible and inedible,\nwe say that \"Verily, our Creator is Subtle, but not like the subtlety of His Creatures in\ntheir workmanship.\"\nAnd we say, \"Verily, He is All-Hearing,\" since the sounds of His Creatures, between the\nThrone and the earth, are not hidden to him, whether they emanate from a mole or\nsomething larger that that, and whether they originate on the land or in the depth of the\nocean. Even their various forms of communication are clear to Him. We say that \"Verily,\nHe is All-Hearing, but not through ears.\"\nThen we say, \"Verily, He is All-Seeing,\" but not through eyes, for He can see even a\nblack speck on a black stone in the darkest night. He can see the tracks of an ant when\nthe night is pitch-black. He sees what is harmful to the ant, beneficial to the ant, and its\nentire cycle of reproduction. And we say, \"Verily, He is All-Seeing,\" but not similar to\nthe sight of His Creatures.\nThe narrator added, \"The man did not leave until he had embraced Islam. The Imam\n(AS) said other things as well.\"",

Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Abu al-Qasim Hamzah ibn\nal-Qasim al-Alawi said: Muhammad ibn Ismail said: Abu Sulayman Dawud ibn Abd Allah\nsaid: Amr ibn Muhammad related to me that Isa ibn Yunus related to me that\nIbn Abu al-Auja' used to be one of the students of al-Hasan al-Basri until al-Basri went\nastray on the subject of Divine Unity. Hence, it was said to him, \"You left the path of\nyour teacher and embraced a belief which has no foundation in reality.\"\nTherefore, he responded, \"Verily, my teacher was confused, Sometime he supported\nthe concept of Free-will [qadr], and sometimes he supported the concept of\nCompulsion [jabr]. I do not know whether he finally embraced one of them.\"\nIbn Abu al-Awja' came to Mecca full of arrogance and in opposition of those who were\nperforming the pilgrimage. He used to abhor the learned ones. However, he would sit in\ntheir gatherings, asking them evil questions conceived in his corrupt mind. On one\noccasion, he came to Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) to question him. Consequently, he\nsat down before him was a group of people who had views similar to his and asked, \"O\nAbu Abd Allah! Verily, meetings should be confidential. If someone has to cough, he\nshould cough. Do you permit me to talk?\"\nSo the Imam (AS) responded, \"Ask whatever you wish.\"\nThen he asked,\nHow much longer will y our people continue to trample underfoot this threshing floor,\nhonor this Stone, serve this House elevated with bricks and clay, and run about it like a\ncamel when it stampedes? Verily, whoever ponders about this will come to know that\nthis ritual was founded by one who was both unwise and without vision. Since your\nfather (the Prophet) established this ritual, and you are the one responsible for this\naffair, will you not explain it to us?\nThen Abu Abd Allah (AS) answered,\nVerily, whoever Allah misguides and whose heart is blind cannot digest the truth; hence,\nhe does not find it pleasant. Satan becomes his guardian and brings him to the\npools of disaster, from which Allah will not save him.\nAllah sought His service from His creation through this House to test the obedience of\nHis Creation. Hence, He urged them to revere it and He urged them to visit it. He made\nit the place of His Messengers and the direction [qiblah] of prayer. Thus, it is a means of\nattaining His Pleasure and a means of attaining His Forgiveness. It has been raised to a\nlevel of perfection, and is a meeting place filled with grandeur and glory. Allah created\nit two thousand years before spreading the earth. He is more deserving for people to\nobey His Commands and abstain from His Prohibitions. Allah is the Producer of Spirits\nand Images.\nIbn Abu al-Awja' said: \"O Abu Abd Allah! You invoked the absent.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) replied, \"Woe be to you! How could He be absent when He is the\nWitness to His Creation, and is closer to them than their jugular vein? He hears their\nspeech sees their figures, and knows their innermost secrets.\"\nIbn Abu al-Awja' asked, \"Then is He is every space? If He is in heaven, then how can\nHe be on earth? And if He is on the earth, then how can He be in heaven?\"\nConsequently, Abu Abd Allah (AS) replied,\nVerily, what you have described only applies to the created. Only the created vacate a\nspace when they change place. As far as the created are concerned, they have no idea\nof their previous space when they take up a new space. As for Allah, the Most Great in\nRank, and the Most Bountiful Sovereign, there is no space free of Him, and no place\nwhich contains Him. There is no space closer to Him than another space. He sent\nMuhammad with His Firm Signs and Clear Proofs, and provided him with His Help. He\nchose him to deliver His Message. We confirm this word that his Lord sent him and\nwhat He spoke to Him (through revelation).\nHence, Ibn Abu al-Awja' left his presence and said to his friends: \"Who poured this\nOcean (of Knowledge) on me?\"\nAnd in the tradition of Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) it states:\n\"Who placed me in this ocean? I asked you to find me some wine, and you dropped me\non the ember?\" They replied, \"You behaved inappropriately in his presence.\" He said:\n\"He is indeed the son of the one who made these people shave their heads.\"",

Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qittan said: Ahmad ibn Yahya said, on the authority of Bakr ibn Abd\nAllah ibn Hubayb that Ahmad ibn Yaqub ibn Matar related to me that Muhammad ibn alHasan bin Abd al-Aziz al-Ahdab al-Jund said in Naysabur that I found in my father's book in\nhis writing: Talhah ibn Yazid said, on the authority of Ubayd Allah ibn Ubayd, on the authority\nof Abu Mamar al-Sadani that\nA man came to the Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) and said: \"O\nCommander of the Faithful! Verily, I have doubted the Revealed Book of Allah.\"\nThe Imam (AS) replied to him, \"May your mother be bereaved of you! How did you come\nto doubt the Revealed Book of Allah?\"\nHe said: \"Because I find some parts of the Book belie some other parts then how\nshould I not doubt in it.?\"\nConsequently, Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) replied, \"Verily, when it comes to the Book of\nAllah, some parts of it verify other parts. However, you have not been given the\nsustenance of wisdom to benefit form it. Bring me what you doubt in the Book of Allah,\nthe Mighty and High.\"\nThe man explained to him (AS), \"I found Allah saying that So today We forget them, as\nthey forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, also: They have forgotten Allah, so He\nhas forgotten them, and said: And your Lord is not forgetful. Thus, once He informs that\nHe does forget and in another place He says that He does not forget. O Commander of the\nFaithful, what is that?\"\nImam Ali (AS) said: \"Bring me what you doubt in.\"\nHe said:\nI have found Allah saying that The Day on which the spirit and the angels shall stand in\nranks; they shall not speak except he whom the Most Compassionate God permits and\nwho speaks the right thing, He says: (they will speak) They would say: By Allah, our\nLord, we were not polytheist, He says: On the Resurrection Day some of you shall deny\nothers, and some of you shall curse others, then He says: That most surely is the truth:\nthe contending one with another of the inmates of the fire, He says: Do not quarrel in\nMy Presence, and indeed I gave you the threatening beforehand, and He says: We will\nset a seal upon their mouths, and their hands shall speak to Us, and their feet shall bear\nwitness of what t hey earned. Therefore, on one occasion He says that they will speak,\nand on another occasion He says: \"they will not speak except he whom the Most\nCompassionate permits and who speaks the right thing.\" In one place He informs that\nthe creation will not speak and describes their statement: \"By Allah, our Lord, we were\nnot polytheist.\" In another place He says that they will quarrel. O Commander of the\nFaithful, why is that? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear (from me)?\nThe Imam said: \"Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.\"\nHe responded,\nI also find Allah, the Mighty and High saying that Faces on that day shall be bright,\nlooking to their Lord, and he says: Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends\n(all) vision; and He is the Knower of Subtleties, the Aware, He says: And certainly he\nsaw him in another descent, a the farthest lotus-tree; He also says: On that day shall no\nintercession avail except of him whom the Beneficent Allah allows and whose word He\nis pleased with. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they do not\ncomprehend it in knowledge. Whoever the eyes have perceived is encompassed in\nknowledge. O Commander of Faithful, why is that? And how shall I not doubt in what\nyou hear?\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.\"\nThe man uttered,\nI also find Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, that And it is not for any man that Allah\nshould speak to him save by revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending a\nmessenger (angel) and to reveal by His permission what He wills, He also says: And\nto Musa, Allah addressed His Word, speaking (to him), and He says: And their Lord\ncalled out to them, and He says, O Prophet! Say to your wives and your daughters and\nHe also says: O Messenger! Deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord. Why\nis that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear?\nThe Imam said: \"Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.\"\nThe man further said:\nI find Allah, High be His Praise, saying that Do you know anyone else named with the\nsame names? He names the human as hearing [sami], seeing [basir], sovereign\n[malik], lord [rabb]. Therefore, at times He says that He has many common names, and\nat other times He says: \"do you know anyone else named with the same name?\" Why is\nthat O Commander of the Faithful? And ho shall I not doubt in what you hear?\"\nThe Imam said: \"Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.\"\nHe said:\nI found Allah, the Blessed and Exalted saying, that And there does not lie concealed\nfrom your Lord the weight of an atom in the earth or in heaven, and that nor will He\nlook upon them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them, and also that Nay!\nMost surely they shall on that day be veiled from their Lord. How does He look at them\nwhen they are veiled? And why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I\nnot doubt in what you hear?\nThe Imam (AS) replied, \"Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.\"\nHe continued,\nAnd I find Allah, the Might and High, saying that Are you secure of those in heaven and\nHe should not make the earth to swallow you up, and that The Most Compassionate\nAllah is firm on the Empyrean, and also that And He is Allah in heavens and in the\nearth; He knows your secrets and your disclosures, and that The Manifested and the\nHidden, and that He is with you wherever you may be, and also that We are nearer to\nhim than his jugular vein. Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And ho shall I\nnot doubt in what you hear?\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Woe unto you! Bring me more what you doubt in.\"\nThe man further said:\nI find Allah, High be His praise, saying that And your Lord comes and (also) the angels\nin ranks, and he said: Verily, you have come to Us alone as We created you at first, and\nsaid: They do not wait aught but that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the\nclouds along with the angels, and also said: They do not wait aught but that the angels\nshould come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your\nLord should come. On the day when some of the Signs of your Lord shall come, its\nfaith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before, or earn good through its faith.\nThus, in one place He says: \"On the Day your Lord should come\" and in another place\nHe says: \"on the Day some of the Signs of your Lord should come.\" Then why is that O\nCommander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear?\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.\"\nThe man continued,\nAnd I find Allah, the Mighty and High, saying that Nay! They are unbelievers in the\nmeeting of their Lord, and when He mentioned the Believer, He said: Who know that\nthey shall meet their Lord and that they shall return to Him, and said: Their greetings\non the Day when they meet Him shall be: \"Peace,\" and He also said: Whoever hopes to\nmeet Allah, then meeting Him is forthcoming, and said: Therefore, whoever hope to\nmeet his Lord, he should do good deeds. Thus, in one occasion, He says that they will\nmeet Him, and on other occasion He says that vision cannot perceive Him, and that He\nperceives all vision. And at another time He says: \"They cannot encompass Him with\nknowledge.\" Then why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt\nin what you hear\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.\"\nThe man said:\nI found Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, that And the guilty shall see the fire, then they\nshall think that they are going to fall into it, and He said: On that day Allah will pay back\nto them in full their just reward, and they shall know that Allah is the evident Truth, and\nHe also said: You began to think diverse thoughts of Allah. So in one place He says that\n\"they think,\" and in another place He says that \"they know.\" Thinking [zann] is doubt.\nThen why is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you\nheard?\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Bring me what you doubt in.\"\nThe man said:\nI find Allah, the Exalted, saying that And We will set up a just balance on the Day of\nResurrection, so no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and He said:\nTherefore, We will not set up a balance for them on the Day of Resurrection, and He\nalso said: These shall enter the garden, in which they shall be given sustenance\nwithout measure, and He also said: And the measuring out on the that day will be just;\nthen as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is heavy, those are they who shall be\nsuccessful; and as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is light those are they who\nhave made their souls suffer loss because they were unjust towards Our signs. Then\nwhy is that O Commander of the Faithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear?\nThe Imam (AS) replied, \"Woe unto you! Bring me what you doubt in.\"\nThe man said:\nI found Allah, the Exalted, saying that Say: The Angel of Death who is given charge of\nyou takes your souls, then to your Lord you shall be brought back, and He said: Allah\ntakes the souls at the time of their death, and He also said: Our Messengers (angels) \ntake his soul away, and they are not remiss, and also said: Thos whom the angels take\naway their souls in a good state, and He also said: Those whom the angels take away\ntheir souls while they are unjust to themselves. Then why is that O Commander of the\nFaithful? And how shall I not doubt in what you hear? Thus, I shall perish if you do not\nhave mercy on me, and expand my chest for me in what might happen by my hands.\nFor if the Lord, the Blessed and Exalted is truth, the book is truth, and the Messengers\nare truth, then I have perished and am in loss. However, if the Messengers are false\nthen it does not matter, and I am saved.\nConsequently, Ali (AS) said:\nOur Lord, the Most Holy, Blessed and Exalted be He, is Elevated, and Great. We bear\nwitness that He is the Ever-Lasting who does not decline. We do not doubt in Him, and\nthere is nothing whatsoever like Him, and He is All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. And we\nbear witness that the Book is truth, the Messengers are truth, and that the reward of\nAllah and the wrath of Allah are true. Thus, if you are given faith, or faith is taken away\nfrom you, then that is Allah's prerogative. If He wishes to bless you, He will and if He\ndoes not wish to, He will not.\nNonetheless, I will clarify the issues in which you doubt. There is no strength or power\nbut Allah. If Allah intends good for you, He will grant you guidance through His\nKnowledge and keep you firm in faith. However, if He wishes evil for you, then certainly\nyou have gone astray and you have perished.\nAs for His Statement: \"They forgot Allah so He has forgotten them,\" Verily, that means\n\"they forgot Allah in this world.\" Since they do not obey Him in this world, He has\nforgotten them in the Hereafter. In other words, He will not reward them. As such, they\nhave been excluded from good.\nSimilar is the explanation of His Word, the Mighty and High \"So today We forget them,\nas they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs.\" What He means by \"the forgetting\" is\nthat He will not reward them like He rewards His Beloved Ones who were obedient to\nHim in this world, and who remembered Him by professing faith in Him and in His\nMessengers, and who feared Him in secret.\nAs for His word: \"And you Lord id not forgetful\" it means that our Lord, the Blessed\nand Exalted, the Elevated, and the Great, is not forgetful or neglectful, rather, He is the\nProtecting, the All-Knowing. The Arabs say about forgetfulness: \"So and so has\nforgotten us,\" i.e. he does not wish good for us not does he remember us with\ngoodness.\nAs a result, have you understood what Allah, the Mighty and High, has mentioned?\nThe man replied, \"Verily, you have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have\nresolved my problem. May Allah increase your reward!\"\nThe Imam (AS) continued,\nAs for His Word: \"The Day on which the spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks; they\nshall not speak except he whom the Most Compassionate God permits and who speaks\nthe right thing,\" and His Word: \"By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists,\" and His\nWord: \"On the Resurrection Day some of you shall deny others, and some of you shall\ncurse others,\" and His Word: \"That most surely is the truth: the contending one with\nanother of the inmates of the fire,\" and His Word: \"Do not quarrel in My Presence, and\nindeed I gave you the threatening beforehand.\" And he says: \"We will set a seal upon\ntheir mouths, and their hand shall speak to Us, and their feet shall bear witness of what\nthey earned.\"\nVerily, these events take place at different times and at different places on the Day that\nwill last fifty thousand years. Allah, the Mighty and High, will bring forth all the\ncreations that Day in different places. Some will speak to others, and some of whom\nwill seek forgiveness for others. They are the obedient ones, and followers of the\n(righteous) leaders in this world. The disobedient ones will curse. They are the ones\nwho incited hatred, and engaged in oppression and aggression on worldly abode.\nThe empowered ones and the weak ones will deny each other and curse each other.\nThe denial [kufr] in this verse refers to immunity. He is that \"some of them shall grant\nimmunity to others.\" It is like the statement of Satan in chapter \"Abraham: \"Verily, I\ndisbelievers in your associating me with Allah before; and the statement of Ibrahim\n(AS) the Friend of Allah: We renounce you, i.e. we disassociate ourselves for you. Then\nthey will unite in another place where they will cry.\nIf those screams arise for the people of this world, they would certainly startle all of the\ncreation from their livelihood, and their hearts would crack except what Allah wills.\nHence, they shall continue to weep bold. Then they will unite in another place where\nthey will be made to speak and say: \"By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists.\"\nTherefore, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, will set a seal upon their mouths, and their\nhands, feet and skins will be made to speak. So they will witness every sin which they\ndid with these parts. Then the seal from their tongues will be raised so they will say to\ntheir skins: Why have you borne witness against us? They shall say: Allah who makes\neverything speak has made us speak.\nThen they unite in another place and will be made to speak, but they will escape from\none another. This is the meaning of the Word of the Mighty and High: The day on\nwhich a man shall fly from his brother, and his mother and his father, and his spouse\nand his son. Thus, they will seek to speak but no one shall speak except for whom the\nBeneficent permits and who speaks the right thing.\nAt this point the Messengers, blessings of Allah be upon them, shall rise and bear\nwitness, to the Word of Allah: How will it be, then, when We bring from every people a\nwitness and bring you as a witness against these? Then they will meet in another place,\nwhere there shall be the place of Muhammad (SA) and that is the Praised Position [almuqam al-mahmud]. Thus, he (SA) will praise Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, the way\nno one has praised Him before him.\nThen he (SA) will praise each and every angel. There shall not remain any angel that he\nwill not have praised. Then he will praise the Messengers (AS) in such way that no one\nhas done so before him. The he (SA) will praise every believing man and believing\nwoman starting with the strictly veracious [siddiqin], the martyrs, and the pious ones\n[salihin]. Then all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth will praise him as we see\nin the Word of Alla: Maybe your Lord will raise you to a praised position.\nHence, blessed are those who have any allotment in that Position, and woe unto those\nwho do not have any allotment or share in that Position. Then they will unite in another\nplace, and some of them will vie the upper hand to others. This is all before the\nAccountability [al-hisab]. Thus, when one is taken to accountability then everyone shall\nbe occupied with what they have before them. We ask Allah for the blessing of that\nDay.\nThe man responded, \"You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful. May Allah\ncomfort you! You have solved my problem. May Allah increase your reward!\"\nThe Imam (AS) then continued,\nAs for His Word: \"Faces on that day shall be bright, looking to their Lord,\" and His\nWord: \"Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends (ALL) vision;\" and His\nWord: \"and verily he saw him in another descent, at the farthest lotustree;\" and His\nWord also: \"On that day shall not intercession avail except of him whom the Most\nCompassionate Allah allows and whose word He is pleased with. He knows what is\nbefore them and what is behind them, while they do no comprehend it in knowledge.\"\nAs for His Word: \"Faces on that day shall be bright, looking to their Lord\" then Verily,\nthat is a place where the Beloved Ones of Allah, the Mighty and High, end up in after\nthey have finished with the accountability to the river which is named al-Hayawan. They\nwill wash in it and drink from it so their faces will be helped to shine. Hence, every\nfloating impurity and difficulty will vanish from them. Then they will be ordered to enter\nParadise. From this position they will look at their Lord, how He rewards them and from\nthere they will enter Paradise.\nThat is the Word of Allah: \"looking to their Lord.\" Verily, what is meant by\n\"looking at Him\" here is \"looking at the reward of the Blessed and Exalted.\"\nAs for His Word: \"Vision comprehends Him not, and He comprehends vision\" then it is\njust as He said: \"vision comprehends Him not,\" i.e. the imaginations cannot\nencompass him. \"He comprehends vision\" i.e. He encompasses vision \"and He is the\nKnower of subtleties, the Aware.\" That is the praise with which our Lord, the Blessed\nand Exalted, has eulogized and extolled Himself, the Elevated, the High.\nMusa (AS) asked and the praise of Allah, the Mighty and High, flowed over his tongue:\nMy Lord! Show me (Thyself), so that I may look upon Thee. Thus, his question was a\ngreat matter and he had asked for a body matter and, hence, was inflicted. So Allah, the\nBlessed and Exalted, said: you will not see me in this world until you die, then you will\nsee Me in the Hereafter.\nHowever, if you intend to see me in this world then look at the mountain, if it remains\nfirm in its place, then will you see Me; therefore, Allah, glory be Him, expressed some\nof His signs and our Lord manifested to the mountain, the mountain had crumbled and\nhad become dust and Musa fell down in a swoon; i.e. he had died. Thus, his infliction\nwas the death, and then he was brought back to life by Allah and he recovered, he\nreturned and said: Glory be to Thee, I turn to Thee, and I am the first of the Believers, i.e.\nthe first who believed in You and who never say You.\nAs for His Word: And verily he saw him in another descent, at the farthest lotus-tree;\ni.e. Muhammad (SA) was at the farthest lotus-tree, as no creation from the creation of\nAllah crosses that position. And Allah's Word a the end of the verse: The eye did not\nturn aside, nor did it exceed the limit, certainly he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.\nHe (SA) saw Jibra'il (AS) in his true form twice, at this time, and at another time. Jibra'il\nis enormous. He is one of the holy ones [rawhaniyin] whose creation and description\ncannot be perceived except by Allah, the Lord of the Universe.\nAs for His Word: On that Day shall no intercession avail except of him whom the Most\nCompassionate Allah allows and whose word He is pleased with. He knows what is\nbefore them and what is behind them, while they do not comprehend it in knowledge.\nThe creations cannot comprehend Allah, the Mighty and High, in knowledge, as He is\nthe Blessed and Exalted. He has placed over the vision of the hearts a veil. Thus, no\nunderstanding reaches Him in form. Nor any heat proves Him with limits. Therefore, no\none attributes Him except with what He has attributed Himself. There is nothing\nwhatsoever like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing, the First, the Last, the\nManifest, the Hidden, the Creator, the Maker, the Imager. He created all things; none of\nthe things are like Him, the blessed and Exalted.\nThe man said: \"You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solved a\nproblem. May Allah increase your reward, O Commander of the Faithful!\"\nThe Imam (AS) then added,\nAs for His Word: And it is not for any man that Allah should speak to him save by\nrevelation or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger (angel) and to reveal by His\nPermission what He wills, and His Word: And to Musa, Allah addressed His Words,\nspeaking (to him), and also His Word: And their Lord called out to them, and His Word:\nO Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the garden! As for His Word: \"And it is not for any\nman that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a veil\" for\nverily it is a must for humankind that Allah may only speak to him through revelation\nand that is not possible except from behind a veil, or by sending an angel to reveal by\nHis permission what He wills. That is what Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has said, the\nElevated and high.\nThe Messenger was revealed unto from the angels of heaven, thus, the angels of heave\ndelivered to the angels of the earth. The speech between the angels of the earth and the\nMessenger did not happen without their speech with the angels of heaven. Hence, the\nMessenger of Allah (SA) said: \"O Jibra'il, have you seen your Lord?\" He replied, Verily,\nmy Lord cannot be seen.\nConsequently, the Messenger of Allah (SA) asked, \"Then where do you take the\nrevelation from?\" He answered, \"I take it from Israfil.\" He (SA) enquired, \"And where\ndoes Israfil take it form?\" He replied, \"He takes it from another angel above him from\nthe divine ones.\" The Messenger (SA) asked, \"And where does that angel take it\nfrom?\" He explained,\" It is thrown upon his heart.\"\nThis is revelation and that is the word of Allah, the Mighty and High, and the word of\nAllah is not (revealed) in one method; among them is what Allah spoke to the\nMessengers, among them is what He threw upon their hearts, among them is what the\nMessengers see in their dreams, among them is inspiration and revelation which is\nread and delivered. That is the word of Allah. Thus, I will suffice with what I have\ndescribed for you of Allah's speech. Verily, the meaning of Allah's Word is not one.\nAmong them is certainly what the angels of heaven deliver to the angels of the earth.\nThe man said: \"You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solved a\nproblem. May Allah increase your reward, O Commander of the Faithful!\"\nThe Imam (AS) then added,\nAs for His Word: Do you know anyone else named with the same name? Verily, the\ninterpretation of that is \"do you know anyone else with the name Allah, other than\nAllah, the Blessed and Exalted.\" Be careful not to explain the Qur'an by your personal\nviews unless you deeply understand it from the learned. For verily, there is revelation\nmany a times resembling the word of man, but it is the word of Allah. So its\ninterpretation does not resemble the word of man, like nothing from His Creation\nresembles Him. Likewise, none of His Actions, the Blessed and Exalted, resemble the\nactions of man and his Word does not resemble the word of man. Thus, the Word of\nAllah, the Blessed and Exalted is His Attribute, and the words of man are their actions.\nTherefore, do not compare the Word of Allah with the word of man for it you do then\nyou shall perish and go astray.\nThe man responded, \"You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solve\na problem. May Allah increase your reward, O Commander of the Faithful!\"\nThen the Imam (AS) continued,\nAs for His Word: And there does not lie concealed from your Lord the weight of an\natom in the earth or in heaven, that is how our Lord is, nothing lies concealed from Him\nand how could it, He who created the things would not know what He created, while He\nis the Creator, the All-Knowing. And as for His Word: nor will he look upon them on the\nDay of Resurrection, He is informing that He will not bestow upon them good. The\nArabs say: \"By Allah, so and so does not look upon us.\" Verily, what they mean by it is\nthat \"he does not bestow us good.\" Thus, that is the \"look from Allah, the Exalted, to\nHis Creation here. So His Look upon them is His Mercy for them. And for His Word:\nNay! Most surely they shall on that day be veiled from their Lord. Verily, what He means\nby this is \"on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be veiled from the reward of their\nLord.\" The man responded, \"You have comforted me. May Allah comfort you! You have solved\na problem. May Allah increase your reward!\"\nThe Imam (AS) then said:\nAs for His Word: Are you secure of those in heaven that He should not make the earth\nto swallow you up? And His Word: And He is Allah in heavens and in the Earth; and His\nWord: The Most Compassionate Allah is firm on the Empyrean, and also His Word: He\nis with you wherever you may be, and also His Word: We are nearer to him than his\njugular vein. Such is Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, the Most Praised, the Most Holy.\nExalted is He from what befalls the creations. He is the Subtle, the All-Informed, and far\nbeyond being compared to His Creation. His Knowledge is firm on the Empyrean. He is\nthe Witness to every whisper. He is the Custodian over Everything, the Creator of\nEverything, and the Director of Everything. Far Exalted is Allah, Elevated and High, from\nbeing on His Empyrean!\nThus, the Imam (AS) continued,\nAnd as for His Word: And you Lord comes and (also) the angels in ranks, and His\nWord: Verily, you have come to Us alone as We created you at first, and also His Word:\nThey do not wait aught but that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the\nclouds along with the angels, and also His Word: They do not wait aught but that the\nangels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs\nof your Lord should come. Verily, this is all truth as Allah, the Mighty and High has said.\nHe does not have a coming like the coming of the creation.\nI have already taught you that there is something from the Book of Allah, interpretation\nof which is other than its revelation and it does not resemble the word of man. I will\nshortly notify you to one of its dimensions and that should suffice you, if Allah willing.\nFrom that is the word of Ibrahim (AS): Surely I am going to my Lord; He will guide me. \nTherefore, his going to His Lord is attention towards Him in service, effort and\ncloseness to Allah, High and Mighty. Do you not see that its interpretation is other than\nits revelation?\nHe has also said: We sent down the iron, wherein is latent mighty power, i.e. the\nweapons etc. They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, He is\ninforming Muhammad (SA) about the infidels and the hypocrites who did not respond\nto Allah and the Messenger.\nSo He said: They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them. As they\ndid not respond to Allah and His Messenger, \"or that your Lord should come, or that\nsome of the signs of your Lord should come.\" What He means by this is that the\npunishment should come to them in this world like He punished the earlier ages. Thus,\nthis is information about them He is giving to the Prophet (SA).\nThen He says: On the day when some of the signs of your Lord shall come, its faith\nshall not profit a soul which did not believe before, or earn good through its faith. That\nis, before this sing comes, this sign is rising of the sun from the west; Verily, it would\nsuffice the ones with intellect, brain and understanding to know that if he removes the\nveil they will see what they have been promised.\nHe has said in another verse: But Allah came to them whence they did not expect, i.e.\nHe sent unto them a punishment. And like is His Coming to their building as Allah, the\nMighty and High, has said: Then Allah came (and demolished) their building from the\nfoundations. Thus, His coming to their buildings from their foundations means sending\nthe punishment over them.\nSimilar is what He has described for the affair of the Hereafter, Blessed and Exalted be\nHis Name, Elevated High. Verily, He will set running His affairs in that Day, which is fifty\nthousand years long, like He set running His affairs in this world. He does not\ndisappear, nor does He pass with the transitory.\nThus, I will suffice with what I have described for you from that which is wandering in\nyour mind of what Allah, the Mighty and High has described in His Book. Do not make\nHis Words like the word of humankind. He is Greater, Mightier, More Generous and\nHigher, Blessed and Exalted from that which the attributers may attribute. Except with\nwhat He attributes Himself in His Word, the Mighty and High: There is nothing\nwhatsoever like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\nThe man said: \"You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah\ncomfort you! You have solved a problem. May Allah increase your reward!\"\nThe Imam (AS) then said:\nAs for His Word: Nay! They are unbelievers in the meeting of their Lord, and when He\nmentioned the Believer: Who know that they shall meet their Lord, and His Word for\nother than the Believers: Till the day when they shall meet Him because they failed to\nperform towards Allah what they had promised with Him, and also His Word: Therefore,\nwhoever hopes to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds. As for His Word: Nay! They\nare unbelievers in the meeting of their Lord, i.e. the raising from death [al-bath] so\nAllah, the Mighty and High, has named it His Meeting.\nLikewise, He has mentioned the Believers: Who know that they shall meet their Lord, i.e.\nthey are certain that they will be raised, gathered, accounted and paid with the\nreward or punishment.\nTherefore, the word zann (strong belief) in this context specifically is \"certainty.\"\nLike is His Word: Therefore, whoever hopes to meet his Lord, he should do good\ndeeds. And His Word: Whoever hopes to meet Allah, then meeting Him is forthcoming, i.e.\nwhoever believes that he will be raised from death, then verily Allah's promise about\nthe reward and punishment is forthcoming.\nHence, here \"the meeting\" is not \"the viewing.\" In fact, it is the raising from death. So\nunderstand this that verily all of \"His Meeting\" in the Book of Allah is meant to be \"the\nraising from death.\" And similar is His Word: their greetings on the Day when they meet\nHim shall be: \"Peace,\" i.e. that \"the faith will not decline from their hearts the Day when\nthey are raised again.\"\nThe man said: \"You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah\ncomfort you! You have solved a problem. May Allah increase your reward!\"\nAt that time the Imam (AS) said:\nAs for His Word: And the guilty shall see the fire, then they shall think that they are\ngoing to fall into it, i.e. they will be certain that they are going to enter it. Similar is His\nWord: Surely I knew that I shall meet my account, He is saying that I am certain that I\nwill be raised and then accounted for. Similar is His Word: On that Day Allah will pay\nback to them in full their just reward, and they shall know that Allah is the Evident\nTruth.\nAnd as for His Word about the hypocrites: \"You began to think diverse thoughts of\nAllah,\" then this zann is doubt and not certainty. Zann is of two types: doubt and\nsurety. Therefore, that which is a matter of the Hereafter, then that is \"the certainty\"\nand that which is of a worldly matter is \"the doubt.\" Pay attention to what I have\nexplained for you.\nThe man said: \"You have comfort me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah\ncomfort you!\"\nThe Imam (AS) explained,\nAnd so for His Word, the Blessed and Exalted: And We will set up a just balance on the\nDay of Resurrection, so no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; that is the\nbalance of justice, all the creations will be taken to it on the Day of Judgment. Allah, the\nBlessed and Exalted, will grant credit to some of the creation from others with the\nbalances.\nThe compiler of this book says: In another tradition \"the balance\" stands for the\nProphets and their Successors (SA) (this one sentence is by the Compiler. The\npassages after it are the continuation of the tradition.)\nAnd as for His Word, the Mighty and High: Therefore, We will not set up a balance for\nthem on the Day of Resurrection, verily this is specifically. And as for His Word: These\nshall enter the garden, in which they shall be given sustenance without measure.\nVerily, the Messenger of Allah (SA) has said:\nAllah, the Mighty and High, says: \"Those who observe Me and love one another for My\nGlory, deserve My love,\" or he said, \"My honor. Verily, on the Day of Judgment their\nfaces will be of the light on the pulpits of light, over which shall be green cloths.\"\nIt was asked; \"Who are they, O Messenger of Allah?\"\nHe replied: \"A group of people who are neither Prophets, not martyrs, but they are ones\nwho loved one another for the Glory of Allah. They will enter Paradise without any\naccountability.\"\nWe ask Allah, the Mighty and High, to make us of them for His Mercy. As for His Word:\nthen as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is heavy...and as for him, whose\nmeasure (of good deeds) is light, i.e. verily, it means the accountability. The good\ndeeds and the bad deeds will be weighed. The good deeds cause the balance to be\nweighty and the bad deeds cause the balance to be light.\nThen the Imam (AS) continued,\nAs for His Word: Say: The Angels of Death who is given charges of you takes your\nsouls, then to your Lord you shall be brought back, and His Word: Allah takes the souls\nat the time of their death, and also His Word: Our messengers (angels) take his soul\naway, and they are not remiss, and also His Word: Those whom the angels take away\ntheir souls while they are unjust to themselves. And His Word: \"those whom the angels\ntake away their souls in a good state, that Peace be on you.\"\nVerily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, directs all affairs as He wills and He assigns from\nHis Creation whoever He wills and whatever He Wills. As for the Angels of Death, verily,\nAllah assigns him specifically whoever He will from His Creation and he assigns His\nMessengers from the angels specifically with whoever He wills of His Creation. The\nangels which Allah, Mighty be His remembrance, has named and assigned them\nspecifically for whoever He wills from His Creation.\nVerily, He, the Blessed and Exalted, directs the affairs however He pleases. Not all\nknowledge makes capable a learned person of explaining to all the people, because\nthere are strong and weak (in understanding) among them. Also, because of them are\nthose who have the strength to bear it and of them are ones who cannot bear it, except\nfor whoever Allah eases the bearing and helps him over it from His beloved ones\nspecifically. Verily, it suffices you to know that Allah is the Reviver and the One who\nmakes to dies. And verily He it is that takes the souls away through whoever He wills of\nHis Creation from the His angels and other than angels.\nThe man said: \"You have comforted me, O Commander of the Faithful! May Allah\ncomfort you! And may Allah benefit all the Muslims by you!\"\nAli (AS) said to the man, \"If Allah has expanded your chest for you with what I have\nexplained for you then you are, by the Splitter of Grain Seed and the Maker of\nHumanity, from the true Believers.\"\nThe man asked, \"O Commander of Faithful, how is it possible for me to find out that I\nam of the true Believers?\"\nHe (AS) replied:\nNo one knows that except for he who Allah has taught him with the tongue of His\nProphet (SA), and the Messenger of Allah (SA) has bore witness for him with Paradise.\nOr he who Allah has expanded his chest to know what is in the Books which Allah, the\nMighty and High, has revealed over His Messengers and Prophets.\nThe man enquired, \"O Commander of the Faithful, who has the strength for that?\"\nHe (AS) explained, \"Whoever Allah expands his chest and directs him to Himself. It is\nup to you to serve Allah openly and secretly, for nothing equals worship.\"\nThe Compiler of this book says: The proof that the Producer is One and not more than\nthat is that if there were two then the matter is not free from being one of the two; that\neach one of them is All-Powerful over prohibiting his associate form whatever He\nintends, or that they are not All-Powerful. If it is so then it is possible for both of them to\nbe prevented, and whatever can be prevented has been brought into being. If they are\nnot All-Powerful, they are incapable and deficient, and only things with beginnings can\nbe as such. Therefore, it is correct that he One without Beginning One.\nThe second proof is that each one of them is not powerful enough to hide from the\nother. Hence, if it is so, the one from whom one can hide, has a beginning. If he is not\nAll-Powerful then he is incapable, and anything which is incapable has beginning as\nwe have already explained earlier. This statement can be used to nullify the concept of\ntwo eternal beings. What Mani and Ibn Daysan have professed is nothing but their own\nsuperstition. The same nonsense which the Zoroastrians [majus] have professed\nregarding the Devil [Ahriman] is equally invalid according to this argument. This\nargument also applies to them. Thus, I have shortened my statement about both of\nthem and did not individually deal with what they asked him (AS).",

He used to research Islam, and sought to debate those Muslims who\nwere familiar with the Christian gospels, and who were familiar with the Messiah,\nhis attributes, arguments, and signs.\nHe says: He had been known for that until he became famous among the Christians,\nMuslims, Jews, and Zoroastrians.

Whoever claims that Allah is\nfrom something, he implies that He is created. Whoever claims that He is in something,\nhe implies that He is limited. And whoever claims that He is on something, He has\nimplied that He is carried.\"\nThe Compiler of this book says: The anthropomorphist cling to the Word of the Mighty and\nHigh: Surely your Lord is Allah, who created heaves and the earth in six days, then\nestablished Himself upon the Empyrean; He throws the veil of night over the day, which\npursues it incessantly. There is no proof in that for them, because He, the Mighty and High,\nmeant by this: then established Himself upon the Empyrean, i.e. then He transferred the\n349\nEmpyrean above the heavens, while He was in control over it and is its Master. His Word, the\nMighty and High: then' refers to raising the Empyrean to the place where it is and transferring\nit to a steady state. Thus, it is not possible for the word [istawa]' to mean taking possession,\nbecause Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, taking possession over the sovereignty and all things\nis not an accidental matter. In fact, He has always been the Master of everything, and in\npossession of everything. Verily, He, the Mighty and High, has mentioned to establish' after\nusing the word then,' and that means to raise' metaphorically. It is similar to His Word: And\nmost certainly We will try you until We have known those among you who exert\nthemselves hard, and the patient. He has mentioned We have known' with His word until,\nwhile He, the Mighty and High, means until the ones who exert exert.' We know this because\nuntil' is only used with an accidental action, while the knowledge of Allah, the Mighty and\nHigh, about the things is not accidental. Similar is the mention of His Word, the Mighty and\nHigh: established Himself upon the Empyrean' after His Word: then.' He means by that\nthen He raised the Empyrean for His Possession over it. He does not mean by that the\nsitting' or proportion of body,' because it is not possible that Allah could be a body or somatic.\nExalted is Allah, the Elevated, and the High, from such things.",

Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMuhammad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Kufi said, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ismail alBarmaki that Jadhan ibn Nasr al-Kandi said: Sahl ibn Ziyad al-Adami related to, on the\nauthority of al-Hasan ibn Mahbub, on the authority of Abd al-Rahman ibn Kathir, on the\nauthority of Dawud al-Raqqi that\nI asked Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) about the Word of the Mighty and High: His\nEmpyrean was on the Water. So he (AS) asked me, \"How do they interpret it?\"\nI answered, \"They say that the Empyrean was on the water, and that the Lord was on\nit.\"\nThus, he (AS) responded, \"They have lied, Whoever claims that implies that Allah is\ncarried, and has described Him on the basis of the attributes of the created, necessarily\nimplying that the thing that carries Him is mightier than He is.\"\nI said: \"May I be your ransom! Could you clarify that for me?\"\nConsequently, he (AS) responded,\nVerily, Allah, the Mighty and High, burdened the water with His Knowledge and His\nReligion, before the existence of the heavens and the earth, jinn or man, and sun or\nmoon. When He intended to create the world, He scattered them before Him, and asked\nthem: Who is lour Lord?'\n351\nSo the first to speak were the Messenger of Allah (SA), the Commander of the Faithful\n(AS), and the Imams, may the blessings of Allah be upon them. They said: You are our\nLord. So he bore them with knowledge and religion.' He then said to the angels: These\nare the bearers of My Knowledge and My Religion. They are My Authorized\nRepresentatives in My Creation, and they are the ones to be asked.'\nThen He said to the children of Adam: Acknowledge the Lordship of Allah, and obey\nthose to whom obedience is due!' Hence, they all replied: Yes our Lord, we\nacknowledge.' Then He ordered the angels: Bear witness!' The angels said: We bear witness. Lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: Surely we were heedless of\nthis. Or you should say: Only our fathers associated others (with Allah) before, and we\nwere an offspring, after them: Wilt Thou then destroy us for what the vain doers died?\"\nO Dawud, our guardianship [wilayah] was emphasized in the covenant.\n2. Tamim ibn Abd Allah ibn Tamim al-Qurashi said: my father said, on the authority of Ahmad\nibn Ali al-Ansari, on the authority of Abu al-Salt Abd al-Salam ibn Salih al-Hirawi that\n\nAl-Ma'mum asked Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS) about the Word of Allah, the\nMighty and High: And He it is who created heaves and the earth in six days, and His\nEmpyrean was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in action.\nHe thus, (AS) replied,\nVerily, Allah the Blessed and Exalted, created the Empyrean, the water, and the angels\nbefore the creation of heavens and the earth. The angels use to ponder over the\nexistence the Empyrean, the existence of the water, and the existence of Allah, the\nMighty and High. Then He place His Empyrean over the water to make His Omnipotence\n352\nover the seven heavens. He created the heavens and the earth in six days, while He was in\npossession of the Empyrean. Although He has the power of creating them in the blink\nof an eye, He, the Mighty and High, created them over six days to show to the angels\nthat He was creating, one after another, so that they could ponder over what Allah,\nexalted be His Remembrance, brought about in stages.\nAllah did not create the Empyrean because He was in need of it. On the contrary, He is\nSelf-Sufficient without any need for the Empyrean and of anything He has created. He\nis not subject to location within the Empyrean, because He does not possess a body.\nExalted is Allah, the Elevated and high, from the attributes of is Creation! As for His\nWord, the Mighty and High: that He might try you, which of you is best in action. Sao\nverily, He, the Mighty and High, crated His Creation to try them through His Obedience,\nand His service, and not for the sake of trial and experiment, because He has always\nbeen the All-knowing of Everything.

Hence, he said:\nVerily, the Empyrean has many different meanings which differ on the basis of their\ncontext in the Qur'an. By His Word: The Lord of the great Empyrean, He is that Great\nSovereign. And by His Word: The Most Compassionate God is firm on the Empyrean,\nHe encompasses by means of His Sovereignty, and this is sovereignty of qualities in\nthings.\nThe connection between the Empyrean and the Throne is unique as they are both\nopenings to the greatest openings of the unseen. Although they are both unseen, they\nare both connected, because the Throne is the apparent opening from which are the\ninnovation and all the things. The Empyrean is the hidden opening in which is found\nthe knowledge of quality, existence, the divine decree, the boundaries, space, will\nintent, knowledge of words, actions, neglect, and the knowledge of the return and the\nbeginning.\nThus, they are both connected openings in knowledge, because the sovereignty of the\nEmpyrean is different from the sovereignty of the Throne, and His Knowledge is more\nunseen than the Knowledge of the Throne. Therefore, it is for this reason that he said:\nThe Lord of the great Empyrean, i.e. its description is grate than the description of the\nThrone, and they are both connected in that.\"\nI asked, \"May I be your ransom. Why does it share the same merit as the Throne?\"\nHe (AS) replied,\nVerily, it shares in its merit because of the knowledge of quality they both contain.\nHowever, the Throne has the apparent openings of the beginning and its whereabouts,\nand the limits of contraction and expansion. Therefore, these two are partners: one of\nthem is the carrier of its partner in exchange. It is similar to the exchange of scholars,\nso they may reason in their claim over the truth of these two, because Allah specifies\nHis Mercy to whomever He wills. And He is the Powerful, the Honorable.\nAmong the different descriptions of the Empyrean is that He, the Blessed and Exalted\nsaid: Lord of the Empyrean from what they attribute (to Him). He described the\nEmpyrean of the Oneness, because a group had associated (Him with it), like I\nexplained to you. The Blessed and Exalted said: Lord of the Empyrean, i.e. Lord of the\nOneness from what they attribute.\nA group attributed Him with two hands, so they said: The Hand of Allah is tied up. A\ngroup attributed Him with two feet, and said: \" \"He put His Foot over the rock of the\nSacred House [bayt al-muqaddas], and from there He ascended to heaven.\" A group\nattributed Him with fingertips, and said: \"Verily, Muhammad (SA) said: I found the\ncoolness of His Fingertips on my heart.\" For the likeness of these attributes He said:\nLord of the empyrean from what they attribute (to Him), that Lord of the highest\nexample from what they resemble Him with.\nFor Allah is the highest attribute, which no one resembles, and He cannot be described\nor imagined. That is the highest attribute.\nThe one who have not been given benefits of knowledge, describe their Lord with\nadjectives which are below Him. They anthropomorphise Him and compare Him with\nthat which they are ignorant of. And you have been given only a little portion of\nknowledge. Thus, He has no compeer, no likeness, and no equal.\nAnd Allah's are the best names, with which no one is named but He. These are the ones\nthat He described in the Book, and said: Therefore, call on Him thereby, and leave alone\nthose who violate the sanctity of his names; ignorantly, and without knowledge.\nTherefore, the ones who violate the sanctity of His Names without knowledge, and\ndescribe Him out of ignorance, actually deny Him while thinking that they are doing\ngood deeds. That is why He has said: And most of them do not believe in Allah without\nassociating others (with Him). Hence, they are the ones who violate the sanctity of His\nNames out of ignorance through misplacing His Names.\nO Hannan! Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has commanded to take a group to be\nthe Guardians.' They are the ones Allah has bestowed with merit, and described them\nin terms with which He has not described others. Thus, He sent Muhammad (SA).\nHe was a guide and leader to Allah until he passed away, with the authorization of the\nMighty and High. Then his successor stood in his place as a guide and leader with\nknowledge according to the guidance and command of the Lord. He was followed by\nthe other Rightly-Guided Imams (AS) [at-Ammat al-Rashidun].",

Each layer is like the first\nthrone to the lower one. There is not a throne that does not exalt and glorify its Lord\nwith praise with different sounds, and in different language. The sounds of the tongues\nare so loud that if He wished them to be heard, they would destroy the mountains,\ncities, and strongholds of the earth; the oceans would overtake the land, destroying\neverything but itself.\nThe Throne has eight pillars.

He (AS) said: \"Does Allah destroy other than\nwhat exists? And does He establish other than that which was nonexistent?\"\n5. Hamzah ibn Muhammad al-Alawi (RA) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim reported to us, on\nthe authority of his father, on the authority of Ibn Abu Umayr, on the authority of Marazim ibn\nHukaym that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said: \"No Prophet claimed to be a prophet until he\nconfirmed his belief in five things with Allah, the Mighty and High: the Appearance,\nthe Will, Prostration, Worship, and Obedience.\"\n6. Hamzah ibn Muhammad al-Alawi (RA) said, on the authority of Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim, on\nthe authority of al-Rayyan ibn al-Salt that\nAl-Rida (AS) said: \"Allah has never sent a prophet until he confirmed with Allah that he\nwould forbid alcohol, and that he believed in the Appearance.\"\n7. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Yaqub\nsaid: Ali ibn Ibrahim said, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of Yunus\nibn Abd al-Rahman, on the authority of Malik al-Juhani that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said:\n\"If people knew what reward there is in speaking about the Appearnac,e they would\nnever cease speaking about it.\"\n8. And with the same chain of transmission, on the authority of Yunus, on the authority of\nMansur ibn Hazim that\nI asked Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS): Is there anything in the knowledge of Allah today\nthat was not there yesterday? He (AS) replied, \"No, May Allah disgrace anyone who\nbelieves in such things!\" I asked, \"Is it correct that everything that has happened, and\neverything that will happen until the Day of Judgment, is known to Allah?\"\nHe (AS) replied, \"Of course! It was so even before He created the creation.\"\n9. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Yaqub\nsaid, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Muhammad ibn Amir, on the authority of Muaalla ibn\nMuhammad that\nThe Learned (AS) was asked: \"How is the knowledge of Allah?\"\nHe (AS) replied,\nHe knows, He wills, He intends, He decrees, He predestines, and He makes to appear.\nTherefore, He exercise what He predestines, He predestines what He decrees, and He\ndecrees what He intends. Thus, through His Knowledge is the Divine Will, through His\nWill is the Intent, through His Intent is the Divine Decree, through His Decree is\npredestination, and through His Predestination is the Exercise of His Will. Therefore,\nthe Knowledge (of Allah) has precedence over the Will (of Allah), the Will (of Allah) is\nsecond, and the Intent (of Allah) is third. The Divine Decree is manifest in\npredestination through the Exercise (of Allah's Will).\nFor Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is the Appearance in whatever He knows, whenever\nHe wills, and in whatever He intends for the decree of the things. Hence, if\npredestination occurs with authorization then there is no appearance. So the\nknowledge of the known exists before it. The Will in the originated is prior to itself. The\nIntent in the intended precedes its existence. The Decree for these known things is\nprior to their detachment and joining, evidently and obviously. Predestination through\nexercise is inescapable from the effective possessors of bodies that can be perceived\nthrough senses like color, smell, weight and measure, and whatever crawls or walks of\nthe humans, the jinn, the birds, the beasts, and other than that which are perceived\nthrough senses.\nTherefore, for Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is the Appearance, of what has no\nexistence, However, if the perceived conceptual existence occurs then there is no\nAppearance. Allah does whatever he wills, and through His Knowledge He knows all\nthings prior to their existence. Through the Divine Will He identifies their attributes and\nlimits; and originate them before their disclosure. Through the Intent He differentiates\nthem in their colors, attributes and limits. Through the Divine Decree He decrees their\ntimes, and knows their beginning and their end. Through Predestination He manifested\nthe places of mankind and led them to these. Through the Exercise of His Will He\nexplained their reasons for being, and manifested their mattes. That is the decree of the\nHonorable, the All-Knowing.\nMuhammad ibn Ali the Compiler of this book, may Allah help him in His obedience, says: The Appearance is not the way the ignorant think, namely, that He appears to\nregret. Exalted is Allah from that. However, it is mandatory upon us to confirm with\nAllah, the Mighty and High, that He has the power of Appearance. The meaning of that\nis: Verily, it is for Him to start something from His Creation to create it before\nsomething, and then that thing becomes nonexistent, and He begins with something\nother than it. Or He orders to do something then stops from doing it, or orders to stop\nfrom something, then orders to do what He had stopped.\nThe examples of that would be the abrogation of previous Shariahs (to Islam),\nchanging of the direction of Qiblah, and the prescribed period [iddat] of a woman\nwhose husband has passed away. Allah does not command His Servants for a matter\nin a specified time except when He knows that it is in their interest in that time. And He\nknows that in another time their interest is in stopping them from the like of which He\ncommanded them to do. Therefore, in all times He commands them for what is in their\ninterest. Thus, whoever confirms for Allah, the Mighty and High, that for Him is to do\nwhat He wills, to destroy what He wills, to create in its place what He wills, to advance\nwhat He wills, to retard what He wills, to command what He wills and how He wills,\nto command what He wills and how He wills, then he has confirmed the doctrine of the\nAppearance.\nAllah, the Mighty and High, has not revered anything better than the confirmation that\nfor Him is the creation, the command, advancement, and to retard and establishing\nwhat does not exist, and to destroy what does exist. The belief in the Appearance is a\nrejection of the Jews, because they said: Verily, Allah concluded the affair. Hence, we\nsaid: Verily, Allah is in a new manifestation everyday. He gives life, and He kills. He\ngives sustenance, and does what He wills. The Appearance is not from regret. It is\ncertainly manifestation of a matter. The Arabs say: A man appeared in my way' i.e.\nmanifested. Allah, the Mighty and High said: And there shall appear to them from Allah\nthat which they had not been expecting, i.e. become plain to them.\nWhenever Allah, Exalted be His Remembrance, observes that a servant observes the\nties of kinship, He increases his life; and whenever He observes that a servant severs\nthe ties of kinship, He decreases his life. Whenever Allah observes that a servant\nfornicates, He reduces his life. Whenever Allah observes that a servant fornicates, He\nreduces his sustenance and shortens his life; and whenever he observes that a servant\nis chaste, He increases his sustenance and lengthens his life.\n10. The aforementioned is supported by the following tradition:\n367\nAl-Sadiq (AS) said:\"Nothing appeared to Allah regarding my son Ismail when He cut\nhim off by death before me, so that it may be known that he was not the Imam after\nme.\"\n11. The following astonishing tradition has been related to me on the authority of Abu allHusayn al-Asadi (RA) that\nAl-Sadiq (AS) said:\n\"Nothing appeared to Allah as regards to my father Ismail (AS) when He ordered His\nfather Ibrahim (AS) to slaughter him, but He ransomed him with a momentous\nsacrifice.\"\nThe Compiler of his book says: In this tradition with both its meanings, I have my\nconsideration. However, I have transmitted them here for the meaning of the word\nappearance' [bada']. Allah is the Director to the correctness.",

Your will is subject to My Will. You fulfill your obligations\nthrough My Power, and through My Bounty you have the strength to disobey me. I have\nmade you seeing, hearing, and strong.

This is why I will not\nbe asked about what I do, while you will be asked about what you did.\nI have made systematic for you everything you wish.\n7.

My father (RA) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim said, on the authority of his father, on the\nauthority of Ali ibn Ma'bad, on the authority of Durust ibn Abu Mansur, on the authority of\nFudayl ibn Yasar that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said: He wills, He intends, He dislikes, and He is\ndispleased. He wills that nothing should exist without His Knowledge, and He intends\nsimilar to that. He dislikes it to be said of Him that He is the third of the three,' and He\nis displeased with His Servant's' disbelief.\n10. Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Abd Allah ibn Ahmad al-Isbahani al-Aswari said: Makki ibn Ahmad\nibn Sadwayh al-BurdhaI said: Abu Mansur Muhammad ibn al-Qasim ibn Abd al-Rahman alAtaki reported to us that Muhammad ibn Ashras said: Bushr ibn al-Hakam and Ibrahim ibn\nNasr al-Suryani both said: Abd al-Malik ibn Harun ibn Antarah said: Ghiyadh ibn al-Mujib\nsaid, on the authority of al-Hasan al-Basri that Abd Allah ibn Umar that\nThe Prophet (SA) said:\n372\nKnowledge has precedence. The Pen has dried up. The Decree has been accomplished\nthrough the Book, and confirmed through the Message. Good fortune is from Allah, and\nadversity s from Allah, the Mighty and High.\" Abd Allah ibn Umar says: The\nMessenger of Allah (SA) used to transmit the following tradition from Allah, the Mighty\nand High, that Allah, the Mighty and High, says: O son of Adam! You wish for what you\nwish through My Will. You intended for what you intend for through My Bounty. You\ndisobey through the strength that I have given you. You fulfill your obligations through\nthe health, protection, and forgiveness that I have granted you. I am worthier of your\nfavor than yourself. And you are worthier of your sin that I am. Hence, any good which\nreached you is reward for your good deeds. And any evil that reaches you in\npunishment for the sins you have committed. As a result of your mistrust in Me, I have\ndeprived you of My Mercy. All praise belongs to Me. And against you is evident proof\n(of your evil-doing). I have a way over you for your disobedience, and reward and the\nbest outcome for you with favour. I do not call upon you to warn you. I do not hold you\nresponsible for issues of honor. And I do not burden you with more than you can bear.\nAnd I did not impose you with the trust except what you have power over. I am pleased\nwith you for Myself with what you are pleased with yourself from Me.\nAbd al-Malik explained: \"I will never punish you except for what you do (wrong).\"\n11. Tamim ibn Abd Allah ibn Tamim al-Qarashi (RA) said: My father said, on the authority of\nAhmad ibn Ali al-Ansari, on the authority of Abu al-Salt Abd al-Salam ibn Salih al-Hirawi that\n\nOne day al-Mamum asked Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (AS).\n\"O son of the Messenger of Allah! What is the meaning of the Word of Allah, the Mighty\nand High: And if your Lord had pleased, surely all those who are in the earth would\nhave believed, all of them; will you then force men till they become believers? And it is\nnot for a soul to believe except by Allah's permission. Consequently, al-Rida (AS)\nreplied, My father Musa ibn Jafar related to me, on the authority of his father Jafar ibn\nMuhammad, on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn Ali, on the authority of his\nfather Ali ibn al-Husayn, on the authority of his father al-Husayn ibn Ali, on the\nauthority of his father Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) that The Muslims said to the Messenger\nof Allah (SA): \"O Messenger of Allah! If you compel the people over whom you have\npower to embrace Islam, then our numbers would increase, and we would have\nstrength over our enemies.\" The Messenger of Allah (SA) replied: \"I could never face\nAllah, the Mighty and High, if I innovated and acted on my own without instruction.\nSurely, I am not those who force people (into faith).\" Hence, Allah, the Blessed and\nExalted, revealed: O Muhammad! And if your Lord had pleased, surely all those who are\nin the earth would have believed, all of them; through (personal) commitment or\nthrough compulsion. They would have believed as those who accept faith after\nobservation, and seeing the strength of the Hereafter. If you compelled them to believe,\nthey would not deserve any reward or praise from Me. Although I want them to believe, I\nwant them to do so freely, and without compulsion. That way, they will earn the right to\nbe in My Proximity, and to receive My Honor, through eternal life in Paradise. Will you\nthen force men till they become believers? As for the Word of the Mighty and High: And\nit is not for a soul to believe except by Allah's permission, it does not mean that the\nsoul has been forbidden from believing. Rather, it means that the soul does not believe\nbut by the will of Allah. For a soul to believe Allah's Will is His Command. The soul is\nnot forced or compelled to believe. Rather, he commits the soul to belief when it is\ndevoid of force or compulsion.\" Al-Ma'mun said: \"You have relieved me O Abu alHasan. May Allah relieve you!\"\n12. My father and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) both said:\nMuhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar and Ahmad ibn Idris both said, on the authority of Muhammad\nibn Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Imran al-Ashari, on the authority of Ibrahim ibn Hashim, on the\nauthority of Ali ibn Mabad, on the authority of Durust, on the authority of Fudayl ibn Yasar\nthat\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said: \"Allah willed for me to be capable, and not to be the\ndoes.\" The reported says: I also heard him saying that He wills, He intends, He dislikes, and\nHe is displeased. He wills that nothing should exist in His Sovereignty without His\nKnowledge, and He intends similar to that. He dislikes it to be said that He is the third\nof three,' and He is displeased with the disbelief of His Servants.\n13. My father and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) both said:\nMuhammad ibn Yahya la-Attar and Ahmad ibn Idris both said, on the authority of Muhammad\nibn Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Imran al-Ashari that Yaqub ibn Yazid said, on the authority of Ali\nibn Hassan, on the authority of Ismail ibn Abu Ziyad al-Shairi, on the authority of Thawr ibn\nYazid, on the authority of Khalid ibn Sadan, on the authority of Muadh ibn Jabal that\nThe Messenger of Allah (SA) said:\nKnowledge had precedence. The Pen has dried up. And the Divine Decree has been\ncompleted by the Book and confirmed by the Message. Good fortune is from Allah, the\nMighty and High, and belongs to those who believe in Allah and fear Him. Adversity is\nfor those who reject the guardianship [wilayah] of Allah over the believers and who\nreject His Immunity for the polytheists. The Messenger of Allah (SA) then continued,\nI transmit my tradition from Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, He says: O son of Adam!\nYou will through My Will. You intend through My Intent. You disobey through My\nStrength. You fulfill your obligations through the health I have given you through My\nHelp and My Protection. I am worthier of your good deeds than you are. And you are\nworthier of your evil deeds than I am. Any good that reaches you is reward for your\ngood deeds. And any evil that befalls you is punishment for your evil deeds. Through\nMy Favour over you, you have strength to obey Me. Since you do not put your trust in\nMe, I have deprived you of My Mercy. All praise belongs to Me. And you shall be judge\non the basis of clear evidence. I have a way over you for your disobedience, and good\nreward for you with favour. I do not call upon to warn you. I do not hold you responsible\nfor issues of honor, and I do not burden you with more than you can bear. I did not\nimpose anything on you but what you confirmed yourself. I am please with you for\nMyself with what you are pleased with yourself for Me.",

My father (RA) said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn\nIsa, on the authority of Abu Abd Allah al-Barqi that Abu Shuayb Salih ibn Khalid al-Mahamili,\non the authority of Abu Sulayman al-Jammal, on the authority of Abu Basir that\nI asked Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) about the issue of capability. Hence, He (AS)\nreplied: \"The issue of capability is not from my statement or the statement of my\nforefathers.\nThe Compiler of this book says: He means by this is that it is neither from my statement or the\nstatement of my forefathers that we say of Allah, the Mighty and High: Verily, He is capable.\nLike the people in the time of Isa (AS) said: Is your Lord capable of sending down to us\nfood from Heaven?\"\n2. Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab said in Naysabur that Ahmad ibn al-Fadl ibn\nal-Mughayrah said: Abu Nasr Mansur ibn Abd Allah ibn Ibrahim al-Isfahani said: Ali ibn Abd\nAllah said, on the authority of Muhammad ibn al-Husayn ibn Abu al-Khattab, on the authority\nof Muhammad ibn Abu al-Husayn al-Qurayzi, on the authority of Sahl ibn Abu Muhammad alMissisi that\nAbu Abd Allah Jafar ibn Muhammad (AS) said:\nA servant cannot act or move unless the ability to act is given to him by Allah, the\nMighty and High. Verily, the legal capacity [taklif] from Allah, the Blessed and Exalted,\nhas occurred after the capability. Thus, no one has legal capacity except the capable.\n3. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: al-Husayn ibn al-Hasan ibn\nAban said, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Said, on the authority of Ubayd ibn Zurarah that\nHamzah ibn Humran related to me that\nI asked Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) about the issue of ability, but he did not answer\nme. So I entered his presence at another time and said:\n\"May Allah be in peace with you! A doubt has entered my heart which nobo0dy can\nremove but you.\" He (AS) said: Verily, what is in your hear will not harm you?\"\nI said: May Allah be in peace with you! AI believe: Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, does\nnot burden His Servants with more than they can bear. They do not do anything except\nby the Intent, Will, Predestination and Decree of Allah.\nHe (AS) responded, \"This is the religion of Allah in which I believe, and in which my\nforefathers believed.\" Or he (AS) said something along those lines.\nThe Compiler of this book says: Allah's Will and His Intent refer to His Command, and the\npleasure found in His Obedience. And in the disobedience is commandment to refrain and\nforbiddance from them through restraint and warning.\n4. My father and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with\nthem) both said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa,\non the authority of Muhammad ibn Khalid al-Barqi, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Yahya\nal-Sayrafi, on the authority of Sabah, al-Hadhdha' that\nAbu Jafar al-Baqir (AS) said:\nZurarah asked him (AS) while I was present, \"Are we capable of fulfilling the obligations\nAllah has made obligatory on us in His Book? And are we capable of refraining from the\nprohibitions which Allah has made obligatory upon us?\" He (AS) thus said: \"Yes.\"\n5. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar (RA) said: My father said, on the authority of\nAhmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of Ali ibn al-Hakam, on the authority of Abd\nAllah ibn Bukayr, on the authority of Hamzah ibn Humran that\nI said to Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS): \"We have something to discuss.\" He (AS) said:\n\"Go ahead.\" I said: We believe: Verily, Allah, the Mighty and High, commands us what\nto do and what not to do. He has decreed and intended the length of life and traces for\nevery soul. He gave each soul the ability to obey Him and to fulfill His Commands.\nHowever, if people were to neglect this, they would be questioned about the capability\nand strength to obey Him. He (AS) then said: \"This is the righteous way, if you do not\nrevert from it.\"\n6. My father and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) both said: Sad ibn\nAbd Allah and Abd Allah ibn Jafar al-Himyari both said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn\nMuhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Fuddal, on the authority of Abu\nJamilah al-Mufaddal ibn Salih, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ali al-Halabi that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said: The servants (of Allah) have not been commanded to\ndo anything more than what they are capable of doing. Therefore, people re able to\nrefrain from whatever they have been enjoined to refrain, and whatever they do not\nhave the ability to refrain from has not been required of them. However, there is no\ngood in people (who do not fulfill their religious obligations.)\n7. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: Muhammad ibn al-Hasan alSaffar said: Muhammad ibn al-Husayn ibn Abu al-Khattab said, on the authority of Ali ibn\nAsbat that\nAbu al-Hasan al-Rida (AS) was asked about the issue of ability. He replied, \"A servant is\ncapable when he possesses four characteristics: his route is free from trouble, his\nbody is healthy, he has all his limbs, and has a means of sustenance provided to him\nby Allah, the Mighty and High.\" I asked, \"May I be your ransom! Explain these reasons\nfor me.\" He explained, In order to be capable, a servant needs to have a route free from\ntrouble. He needs to have a healthy body. And he needs to have all his limbs. He may\nintend to fornicate, but at first he does not find a woman then he finds one. Then, either\nhe would be protected by Allah and he would stop from it as Yusuf (AS) did; or Allah\nwould abandon him between him and his intentions. Thus, he would fornicate and\nwould be labeled a fornicator. He has not obeyed Allah from compulsion, and did not\ndisobey because he was coerced.\n8. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: al-Husayn ibn al-Hasan ibn\nAban said, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Said, on the authority of Hammad ibn Isa, on the\nauthority of al-Husayn ibn al-Mukhtar, on the authority of Ismail ibn al-Jabir, that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said: Verily, Allah, the Mighty and High, created a creation\nand knew they will not proceed to Him. He command them what they should o, and\nwhat they should not do. He never commands people to do something, unless He gives\nthem the means to do it. And He never commanded people to refrain from doing\nsomething unless He gives them the means from refraining from it. People never obey\nor disobey but by the permission of Allah, the Mighty and High, i.e. with His Knowledge.\n9. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: al-Husayn ibn al-Hasan ibn\nAban said, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Said, on the authority of Fadalah ibn Ayyub, on\nthe authority of Aban ibn Uthman, on the authority of Hamzah ibn Muhammad al-Tayyar that\nI asked Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) about the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: And\nverily they were called upon to make obeisance while yet they were safe.\nHe (AS) said: \"The capable are capable of fulfilling the obligations that have been\nimposed on them. And the capable are capable of refraining from the prohibitions that\nwere imposed on them. They will be tried through both obligation and prohibition.\"\nThen he added, \"There is nothing which has been commanded or prohibited by Allah, the\nExalted, the Mighty and High, that is not a trial and predestined.\"\n10. My father and Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil (RA) both said: Sad ibn Abd Allah\nand Abd Allah ibn Jafar al-Himyari both said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn\nIsa, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Mahbub, on the authority of al-Ala' ibn Razin, on the\nauthority of Muhammad ibn Muslim that\nI asked Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) about the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: And\npilgrimage to the House is incumbent upon men for the sake of Allah, (upon) everyone\nwho is able to undertake the journey to it. He (AS) said: \"He should have the means to\nperform the pilgrimage [hajj].\" I asked, \"What happens if someone offers to pay for your\npilgrimage, and you fill embarrassed about accepting his offer?\"\nHe (AS) replied, \"Such a person would be counted among those who have the ability (to\nperform the pilgrimage).\"\n11. My father and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) both said: Sad ibn\nAbd Allah said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of\nMuhammad ibn Khalid al-Barqi, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Abu Umayr, on the\nauthority of Hisham ibn Salim, on the authority of Abu Basir that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said: \"Whoever is offered the means to perform the\npilgrimage, even if it means riding on the back of a mutilated, mangled tailed donkey\nhas the means of performing the pilgrimage, even if he refuses the offer.\"\n12. My father and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) both said: Sad ibn\nAbd Allah said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of Sad\nibn Janah, on the authority of Awf ibn Abd Allah al-Azdi, on the authority of his paternal uncle that\nI asked Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (as) about the issue of capability. So he (as)\nresponded, \"Have they done so?\" I said: \"Yes. They claim that the ability to do\nsomething applied only at the onset of the action and the intention at the time of the\naction, but not before it.\" He (AS) replied, \"These people have disbelieved.\"\n13. My father (RA) said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said, on the authority of Yaqub ibn Yazid, on the\nauthority of Muhammad ibn Abu Umayr, on the authority of some of our scholars who he\ntransmitted from, that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said: \"A servant (of Allah) is not able to accomplish an\naction unless he has the ability to do so. Sometimes he has the ability to accomplish an\naction, but he does not do it. However, he can never accomplish an action unless he\nhas the ability to do so.\"\n14. My father (RA) said; Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim said, on the authority of his father, on the\nauthority of Muhammad ibn Abu Umayr, on the authority of Hisham ibn al-Hakam that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) was asked to interpret the Word of Allah, the Mighty and\nHigh: And pilgrimage to the House is incumbent upon men for the sake of Allah, (upon)\nevery one who is able to undertake the journey to it. What does He mean by this? He\n(AS) replied, \"He means that whoever has a healthy body, a route free from trouble,\nproper provision, and a mode of transportation.\"\n15.My father and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) both said: Sad ibn\nAbd Allah said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of Abd\nAllah ibn Muhammad al-Hajjal al-Asadi, on the authority of Thalabah ibn Maymun, on the\nauthority of Abd Al-Ala ibn Ayun, that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) asked to interpret this verse: Had it been a near advantage\nand a short journey, they would certainly have followed you, but the tedious journey\nwas too long for them; and they swear by Allah: If we had been able, we would certainly\nhave gone forth with you; they cause their own souls to perish, and Allah knows that\nthey are most surely liars. He (AS) said: \"They indeed had the ability. Allah knew that\nthey would have carried out their duty had it been a short and advantageous journey.\"\n16. My father and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) both said: Sad ibn\nAbd Allah said: Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa said, on the authority of Ali ibn Abd Allah, on\nthe authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Barqi that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) was asked to interpret the Word of Allah, the Mighty and\nHigh: And they swear by Allah: If we had been able, we would certainly have gone f",

    "Content": "6. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Yaqub alKulayni through his source of transmission, said\nWhen Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) had a word with Ibn Abu al-Awja', he returned to\nAbu\nAbd Allah (AS) the next day and sat down speechless. Therefore, Abu Abd Allah (AS)\nsaid: \"It seems as if you have returned to discuss some of the things we discussed\nbefore.\"\nHe replied, \"That is what I intend, O son of the Messenger of Allah!\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said: \"How astonishing is this? You reject Allah, but you bear\nwitness that I am the son of the Messenger of Allah.\"\nHe responded, \"It is a custom and a formality.\"\nThe Learned [al-alim] (AS) said to him, \"Then what prevents you from speaking?\"\nHe replied, \"My reverence for you. Even my tongue venerates you, preventing it from\nverbalizing anything. Verily, I have consulted with scholars and debated with\ntheologians, but never has such a sense of awe entered me as when I am in your\npresence.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"That may be the case. However, I will start with a question.\"\nHe approached him, and asked: \"Are you created or uncreated?\"\nAbd al-Karim ibn Abu al-Awja' answered, \"I am not created.\"\nSo the Learned (AS) asked him, \"If you are uncreated, then describe to me how you\nwould be, had you been created?\"\nAbd al-Karim was baffled and unable to answer for a long time, focusing his eyes on\nthe piece of wood that was before him. He was saying \"Long, wide, deep, short,\nmoving, motionless, all of these are descriptions of its creation.\"\nThe Learned (AS) said to him, \"If you do not know the description of its formation, then\ncreate yourself on the basis of yourself.\"\nAbd al-Karim replied to him, \"You have posed a question that nobody has ever posed\nto me before, and which nobody will ever ask me after you.\"\nAbd Abd Allah (AS) responded to him,\nYou admit that this question has never been asked of you in the past. However, how\ncan you know that this question will never be posed to you in the future? O Abd alKarim! You have negated yourself, because you claimed that all things are the same in\nthe beginning. How, then can you precede or delay things in time?\nHe (AS) then continued,\nO Abd al-Karim! I will further clarify matters for you. If you had a bag which contained\njewels, and someone asked you \"Is there a gold-coin [dinar] in the bag?\" you would\ndeny that there is a gold-coin in bag. If the questioner then asked you \"Describe for me\nthe gold-coin,\" when you did not know how to describe it, would it be right for you to\ndeny its existence simply because you cannot describe it?\"\nHe replied, \"No.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) then responded to him, \"The universe, however, is far greater,\nlonger, and wider than the bag. Likewise, it is possible that there is something in the\nuniverse that was created but which you cannot describe from the uncreated.\"\nAbd al-Karim withdrew, but some of his friends surrendered to reason and embraced\nIslam while other remained obstinate in their unbelief as he did.\nHe returned on the third day and said: May I redirect the question?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said to him, \"Ask whatever you may wish.\"\nSo he asked, \"What is the proof for the emergence of bodies?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) replied,\nVerily, in contemplating all things, big, and small, I found that they all increase or\ndecrease from their original state. If they were eternal, however, then they would\ndecline or increase from their original state. This is because anything which can decline\nor change can be located and can disappear. Anything that exists after nonexistence\nhas emerged. And anything that exists did not exist at one point. Eternity (sempiternity)\nand nonexistence cannot co-exist in the same thing.\nAbd al-Karim said: \"On the basis of your reasoning, nothing that changes can be\neternal, and must have emerged. So, if something always remains small, how can it be\nsaid to have emerged?\"\nThe Learned (AS) answered,\nVerily, we are talking about this universe. Were it to be taken away and replaced with\nanother one, nothing would be left of the first one. That is sufficient proof that it has\nbeen taken away and replaced by another one. However, I shall answer you on the\nbasis of your assumption.\nWe say: Even if something remains small, that small thing could join with another small\nthing, and thus become bigger. And since it is subject to such change, it cannot be\neternal. Consequently, anything that is subject to change has emerged. There is\nnothing beyond that for you, O Abd al-Karim.\"\nSo he withdrew, full of shame and disgrace.\nWhen the next year approached, the Imam (AS) met him in the Sacred Mosque in\nMecca. So some of his followers [shiah] said to him: \"Ibn Abu al-Awja' has become a\nMuslim.\" The Learned (AS) replied, \"He is blinded from faith. He will not submit.\"\nWhen he saw the Learned, he said: \"My Master, my Guardian.\"\nThe Learned (AS) asked him, \"What brings you to this place?\"\nHe answered, \"It is a custom. It is the practice of the town. And we want to watch all\nthese crazy people shave their heads and throw pebbles at Satan.\"\nHence, the Learned (AS) said: \"You remain firm in your arrogance and misguidance, O\nAbd al-Karm.\"\nWhen he started to talk, the Learned (AS) said to him, \"There is no quarrel in the\npilgrimage.\" Then the Imam (AS) shook off his cloak from his hand and said: \"If things\nare as you say, and they most certainly are not, then we are both saved. However, if\nthings are the way we ay, and they most certainly are, then we are saved and you are\ndestroyed.\"\nAbd al-Karim drew closer to the ones that were with him, and said: \"My heart is filled\nwith rancour. Take me away from here.\" Therefore, they took him out, and he died, may\nAllah deprive him of mercy!\nThe Compiler of this book says: Among the proof that bodies emerged is that bodies\nare subject to increase and decrease. They are subject to growth and development\nwhich makes them into different forms and shapes. Evidently, we already know that we\nhave not formed our bodies, nor anyone from our species has formed them. It is not\nrational to believe that bodies, which are subject to change, growth, development, and\nmeasure, and which are not eternal, can come about without a Planner.\nIf it is possible for the universe and all it contains to be without a Producer or a Creator,\nthen it would also be possible for smaller things. If this were the case, then we should\nbe able to find texts without authors, buildings without builders, and paintings without\npainters. However, it is not possible to find a boat that was not expertly designed by a\nbuilder. If all of this is impossible, then so is the argument that something can exist\nwithout a Creator. Everything we have mentioned, and which we have not mentioned, is\nsubject to change: the skies, time, the sun and the moon, their rising and their setting,\nthe seasons, trees and their fruits; the denial of which is the most obstinate\nstubbornness. This is clear. All praise be to Allah!\nI have asked one of the learned monotheists regarding proof that bodies emerged. He\nsaid: The proof that bodies emerged is that their existence is not separate from His\nExistence. The bodies do not have individual existence. They exist along with others.\nWhenever a body exists along with others, it cannot be unique, and can only have been\ncreated. Therefore, the body is created as it cannot be separate from the Creator nor\nprecede it.\nAnd among the proofs that Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is not a body is that there is\nnot a body that does not have a body that resembles it, which is physically present or\nat least imaginable. Whatever has a similarity of any kind is created and has emerged.\nTherefore, since Allah, the Mighty and High, is Eternal, it proves that He is devoid of a\nbody. One more thing: if someone speaks of a \"body\" literally, it subject to increase\nsince it applies to something which can be measured in terms of length and width, and\nsomething which is composed of parts.\nIf someone says: Verily, Allah, the Mighty and High, possesses a body, this statement\ncould only be true if one proves that the aforementioned descriptions could apply to\nHim. If what we have mentioned before can apply to Him, then it could only mean two\nthings: one, that He is created, and that he emerged like all bodies; or two, that all\nbodies are eternal. However, if the word \"body\" does not convey this meaning, and is\nonly the name of a word, then it is a convention. Thus, it would be like someone calling\nAllah, the Mighty and High, a human, composed of flesh and blood, metaphorically, and\nnot literally. However, the Names of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, should only be\ndrawn from the names which He Himself has used, or which have been taught to us by\nthe Messenger of Allah (SA) or the Rightly Guided Imams (AS).",

    "Content": "7. Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qittan said: al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Sukkari said: Muhammad ibn\nZakariyya said, on the authority of Jafar ibn Muhammad ibn Uamrah, on the authority of his\nfather, on the authority of Jafar ibn Muhammad, on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn\nAli, on the authority of his father Ali ibn al-Husayn, on the authority of his father, al-Husayn\n(AS) that\nThe Commander of the Faithful (AS) said:\nVerily, the body has six states: health, illness, death, life, sleep and wakefulness. Similar is\nthe spirit: its life is its knowledge, its death is its ignorance, its illness is its doubt, its health\nis its certainty, it sleep is its negligence, and its wakefulness is its preservation (against\nevil).\nThe Compiler of this book says: And amongst the proofs of the bodies having emerged is that\nthe bodies are not free from co-existence or separation, or from being in motion or being\nstill. Co-existence, separation, motion and stillness have all emerged. Therefore, we have\nlearnt that the body has emerged due to the emergence of what does not separate from it, not\nprecedes it.\nIf someone says: Why did you say: Co-existence and separation are two independent\nconnotations and likewise motion and stillness, so that you may claim that the body is not\nfree from them?\nIt would be replied to him: The proof of that is we find the body co-existing after being\nseparated, while it is possible for it to remain separated. If it was not so that it had emerged,\nthen it would not be more worthy for it to co-exist than to remain separated on what it was,\nbecause it dos not emerge itself in this time, so it may have emerged itself on what has coexisted.\nNeither has it annulled it this time so that it may exist due to its annulment. It is not\npossible for what has co-existed to take its meaning due to annulment. Do you not see that if\nit was so that it would not co-exist but due to annulment of a meaning or it would not\nseparated but due to annulment of a meaning, then it would necessitate for it to co-exist and\nseparate within one state due to the annulment of both meanings? Also, if everything was free\nform containing the meaning of co-existence and separated, then it would necessitate for the\naccidents to e co-existent and separated, because they are free of these (four) meanings. Its\nannulment has been explained and the proof of its annulment is that it co-exists due to\nemergence of a meaning and separated due to emergence of a meaning. Similar is the case\nfor the motion and stillness and all other accidents.\nIf someone says: if you said: The co-existent becomes co-existent due to the being of the\nco-existence and becomes separated due to the separation. Thus, why have you rejected it\nbecoming co-existent or separated due to both of their existence in it? Similarly, you\nnecessitate this statement: The co-existent becomes co-existent due to the negation of\nseparation and the separated becomes separated due to the negation of co-existence.\nIt would be replied to him: Indeed the co-existence and separation are opposites. Opposites\ndo not appear in one existence at the same time. However, this ruling does not apply in the\nnegation, because the negation of two opposites cannot be rejected in an existence at the\nsame time unlike their subsistence. This is why we have said that if a body co-exists due to\nnegation of separation and is separated due to negation of co-existence; it would necessitate\nfor them to become co-existent and separated due to the negation of separation and is\nseparated due to the negation of co-existence; it would necessitate for them to become coexistent\nand separated due to the negation of both of them. Is it not so that both black and\nwhite colors are negated from a red color, while both are opposites? However, it is not\npossible for both of them to be present and co-exist at one time. Thus, it is proved that\nnegation of opposites cannot be rejected in one state like the way their affirmation can be\nrejected. Also, the one saying this has proved the co-existence, separation, motion and\nstillness and has necessitated that body cannot be free from them, because if it was free from\nthem it would necessitate for it to co-exist, be separated, be in motion and be still. For if it was\nfree from them it will not be attributed with this ruling. If the matter is such, and the body is not\nfee from these changes then it necessitates its being emerged. What also indicates this is that\nthe human being is ordered on co-existence, separation, motion and stillness and it carries\nthem out, and is praised for it, thanked for it and condemned over it if it was evil. We now\nknow that it is not possible to command the body to do or not to do, nor to praise it for that\naction or denounce it. Therefore, it is necessary for who can be commanded to do or not to do\nand deserves praise or criticism for that action to be other than the one who cannot be\ncommanded to do or not to do and not deserve praise or criticism for it. The requirement of\nthis is the affirmation of the accidents.\nIf he said: Why do you accept: The body is not free form co-existence, separation, motion and\nstillness. And why do you reject that it has never been free of them? Thus, this does not\nindicate upon the emergence of a body.\nIt would be replied to him: If it has ever been possible for it to be free from co-existence,\nseparation, motion and stillness then it would be possible now and we should witness it.\nTherefore, when it is not possible to find bodies without co-existence or separation, then we\ncome to know that they have never been free of them in the past.\nIf he says: Why do you reject that if the bodies could not be free of these in the past then it is\nnot possible for the bodies to be free of them in present?\nIt would be said to him: Time and space do not have an effect in this matter. Is it not so that if\nsomeone says: I was free from this in the first year r for twenty years and it has become\npossible for me after this period? Or it is possible for me in Syria but not in Iraq or it is possible\nin Iraq but not in Hejaz; he would be perplexed and ignorant to the wise and whoever\nendorses him would also be ignorant. Therefore, we know that time and space do not affect in\nthis. If there is no rule and effect in this matter, then it is necessary that the rule of body\napplies to it in what has passed and in what will come in the future has the ruling of the\npresent. When it is not possible for the body to be free in present form co-existence or\nseparation, and motion or stillness, we lean that it can never be free from these ever. If it could\nbe free form these in the past, then it cannot be rejected that it can remain as that in the\npresent. So if someone informs us about an unknown town that bodies there were neither coexistent\nnor separated, neither in motion nor still, then we would doubt in that and not believe\nthat to be true. The annulment of that proof is the annulment of this statement. Moreover,\nwhoever proves that bodies are neither co-existent nor separated, most definitely proves them\nto be neither close together to one another nor far apart from each other. This attribution\ncannot be rational, because there should be either partition and distance between two bodies, or\nthere should not be any partition and distance between them; there is not third way. If there\nis partition and distance between them, they would be separated. However, if there is no\npartition and distance between them, it would be necessary fro them to be co-existent,\nbecause this is the limit of the co-existence and separation. If it is so then whoever proves that\nbodies are neither co-existent nor separated, is proving them with an attribute that is not\nrational. And whosoever goes out of the boundary of rationality is a void-doer.\nSo if he says: Why do you accept that: The accidents are emerged and reject that they are not\neternal and are always connected to bodies?\nI would be replied to him: Because we find the co-existent when separated, the co-existence is\nannulled from it and separation emerge to it. Similar is the separated when made t co-exist,\nthe separation is annulled from it and the co-existence emerges to it. The eternal is eternal\ndue to itself. It is not possible for it to emerge and be annulled. Therefore, it is proved that the\nco-existence and separation are both emerged and like is the case for all accidents. Is it not so\nthat they are annulled by their contraries then emerge after that. Whatever has the possibility\nof emergence and annulment cannot be but emerged. Further more, the eternal being which\ncontinues have no need in its essence to a creator, clarifying that it is worthier of being\nexistent than nonexistent, because if it is not so then he would too exist but through a creator.\nIf it is so then we know that the eternal cannot be annulled, if it is worthier of being existent\nthan nonexistent. And that whatever can be annulled, cannot be eternal.\nIf he says: Why do you say that whatever does not have precedence over the emerged, it is\nnecessary for it to be emerged?\nIt would be replied to him: Because the emerged is that which comes about after not being\nthere and the eternal is the existent that has always been there. The existent that ahs always\nbeen there is necessarily the preceding over the one that came about after not being there.\nWhatever has not proceeded is the emerged. Therefore, its share of the essence is the share\nof the emerged, because it does not have the precedence but of the emerged. If it is so then\nthe emerged does not have the share of the eternal in the essence and precedence. Rather it\nwould be of the emerged. In addition whatever shares in its cause or is equal in its essence\nand does not have precedence over it then it is necessary for it to be emerged.\nIf he says: Is it not so that he body is free form accidents and it is not necessary for it to be an\naccident then why do you reject that it is not free from changes and that it is not necessary for\nit to have emerged?\nIt would be replied to him: We have attributed the accident [arad] that it is not of the attributes\nof precedence and subsequence. It is indeed informing about genuses of the accidents. If the\nbody does not precede it then it is not necessary that it may become from their genus. This is\nwhy it is not necessary for the body to be an accident, even if it does not precede over\naccidents, if it does not share the accidents in what makes them accidents. We attributed the\neternal that it is informing about its precedence and its essence not having any prior to it. And\nwe attributed the emerged that it is informing about its being connected with a finish and an\nend, and a beginning and start. If it is so, then whatever has no bodies preceding over it, it is\nnecessary for it to remain to a finish and an end, because it is no possible for an existence that\nis not present from the beginning to have precedence over another existence that is present\nfrom the beginning. If this is true, then the emerged shares in what it has emerged and that is\nits existence to an end. This is why it necessitates to be emerged for its existence to a finish\nand an end. Similar is the answer to all what one may ask in this matter from this issue.\nIf someone says: if it is proven that the body has emerged then what is the proof that it has\nOne who has emerged it?\nIt would be said to him: Because we find changes in their entirety are connected to the\nemerged.\nIf he says: Why do you say that the emerged are connected to the emerged for what it is?\nIt would be replied: Because if they were not emerged, they would not be in need of a creator.\nIs it not so that they were non-emerged existents or were nonexistent, it would not be\npossible that they may be connected to the emerged. If it is so then it is proven that they are\nconnected to the emerged for what the emerged is. Therefore, it is necessary for every\nemerged being to have their ruling that every emerged being requires a creator or one that\nemerges them.\nThese are proofs of the supporters of the Unity (of God), which are in accordance with the\nBook and the authentic traditions of the Prophet (SA) and the Imam (AS).",

Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qittan and Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq\n(may Allah have mercy on them both) said: Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Zakariyya al-Qittan said: Muhammad ibn al-Abbas said: Muhammad ibn Abu al-Suri related to me that Ahmad ibn abd\nAllah ibn Yunus said, on the authority Sad al-Kinani, on the authority of al-Asbagh ibn\nNubatah that\nWhen Ali (AS) assumed the Caliphate, and the people were paying allegiance to him, he\nleft for the Mosque wearing the turban, the outer garment [burdah], the shoes, and the\nsword of the Messenger of Allah (SA). He (AS) went up the pulpit. He saw down\nfirmly. He crossed his fingers. He placed his hands cross his stomach. And he (AS) said:\nO assembly of People! Ask me before you are deprived of me. This is the vessel of\nknowledge. This is (the effect of) the saliva of the Messenger of Allah (SA). This is what\nthe Messenger of Allah (SA) fed me like the feeding of a bird. Ask me, for verily, I have\nthe knowledge of the First Ones and the Last Ones.\nBy Allah, if a cushion were folded up for me, I could sit on it and judge the believers in\nthe Torah on the basis of the Torah until the Torah would profess: Ali has spoken the\ntruth, and has not lied. He has judged you according to what Allah revealed through\nme.' I could judge the believers in the Bible on the basis of the Bible until the Bible\nwould profess: Ali has spoken the truth, and has not lied. He has judged you\naccording to what Allah has revealed through me.' And I could judge the believers in\nthe Qur'an on the basis of the Qur'an until the Qur'an would profess: Ali has spoken\nthe truth, and has not lied. He has judged you according to what Allah ha revealed\nthrough me.' All of you read the Qur'an day and night. Does anyone of you know what\nis revealed in it? If it were not for a single verse in the Book of Allah, I would have\ninformed of everything that has happened in the past, everything which is happening in\nthe present, and everything which will happen in the future up to the Day of Judgment.\nThat verse is this: Allah makes to pass away and establishes what He pleases, and with\nHim is the basis of the Book. He (AS) then continued: Ask me before you are deprived\nof me. By Allah who split the grain seed and the made the persons, if you asked me\nabout each and every verse; whether it was revealed during the day or during the night,\nwhether it was revealed in Mecca or Medina, or revealed while traveling or not while\ntraveling, the abrogating verses or the abrogated ones, the decisive verses or the\nalloys, and their interpretations and their context, I would inform you.\nA man called Dhilib, who was sharp of tongue, eloquent in speaking, and brave at\nheart, stood up and said: \"The son of Abu Talib has certainly climbed on a difficult\nladder. In questioning him I will surely humiliate him today for all of you.\" Then he\naddressed the Imam (AS) and said: \"O Commander of the Faithful, have you seen your\nLord?\" The Imam (AS) replied, \"Woe to you, O Dhilib! I do not serve a lord that I\nhave not seen.\" He said: \"How did you see him? Describe Him for us.\" Ali (AS)\nresponded,\nWoe to you, O Dhilib! The eyes do not see him through means of vision, but the\nhearts see Him through certainty of faith. Woe to you, O Dhilib! Verily, my Lord\ncannot be described in terms of proximity or movement. He is the Most Subtle of the\nSubtle and cannot be described in terms of subtletly. He is the Greatest of the Great\nwhose greatness cannot be described in terms of greatness. He is the Grandest of the\nGrand whose grandeur cannot be expressed in terms of grandeur. He is the Highest of\nthe High whose highness cannot be described in terms of toughness. He is the Most\nAffectionate of the Affectionate whose mercy cannot be described in terms of\ndelicateness. He is the granter of Security, but not through sevice. He perceives not by\ntouch, nor speaks though enunciation. He is Present in all Things, but not physically.\nAnd he is Absent in All thins, but not through conflict. He is Above all Things, yet it\ncannot be said that something is above Him. He is in Front of All Things, but it cannot\nbe said: He as a front. He Permeates all Things, but He is neither inside nor outside\nthem.\nDhilib dropped fainting, and when he woke up again, he said: \"By Allah, I have never\nheard the likeness of this reply, and by Allah I shall never ask such questions again.\"\nThe Imam (AS) then continues: \"Ask me before you are deprived of me.\"\nSo al-Ashath ibn Qays stood before him and asked, \"O Commander of the Faithful!\nWhy are the Zorastrians taxed [jizyah] when no book was revealed to them and no\nprophet was sent to them?\" The Imam (AS) replied, O Ashath! Allah certainly revealed\na Book for them, and sent them a Messenger. They once had a king, who got drunk one\nnight, called his daughter to his bed, and committed incest with her.\nWhen he got up in the morning, the people heard of this, gathered at his door and said:\n\"O king! You have defiled and disgraced our religion and destroyed it. Come out at\nonce so that we can purify you through the legal punishment [hadd].\"\nHe replied to them: \"Gather together, and listen to my speech. If there is a way out for\nme from what I have perpetrated, then so be it. Otherwise, do with me as you please.\"\nSo they gathered and he addressed them: \"Do you know that Allah has not created a\ncreation more honorable to Him than our father Adam and our mother Eve?\" They\nreplied: \"You are right, O king.\" He said: \"Is it not so that his sons married his\ndaughters and his daughters married his sons?\" They answered: \"You are right. This is\nthe religion.\" Based on that they contracted in marriage. Hence Allah took away the\nknowledge from their chests, and raised the Book from them. Thus, they are\nunbelievers. They shall enter the Hell without any accountability and the hypocrites\nare worse off than them. Ashath said: \"By Allah, I have never heard the likeness of this\nreply, and by Allah I shall never ask such questions again.\" The Imam (AS) then\ncontinued: \"Ask me before you are deprived of me.\" So a man from further away in the\nMosque stood up, leaning on his stake. He crossed all the people until he was close to\nthe Imam (AS). Then he said: \"O Commander of the Faithful! Teach me something that\nwill save me from the Fire.\" Ali (AS) said to him, Listen to me, O man, and understand!\nThis world is established on three things: on a leaned person who speaks using his\nknowledge; on a wealthy person who is not miserly with his wealth towards the\nreligious; and on a patient poor person. Thus, if the learned hides his knowledge, the\nwealthy acts miserly, and the poor do not practice patience, they shall meet the\naffliction and ruin. At that point the recognizers of Allah know that he house will return\nto its origin, i.e. disbelief after faith. O Questioner, do not be dazzled over large\nnumbers of mosques and groups of people who are united in their bodies, but\nseparated in hearts. O questioner! Verily, there are three types of people: the ascetic\n[zahid], the hedonist [raghib], and the patient person [sabir]. As for the ascetic, he is\nnever pleased with anything from this world that comes to him nor is he displeased\nover anything that expires from him. As for the patient person, he longs for the world\nfrom his heart, but when he finds anything from it he refrains from it due to knowing its\nevil result. As for the hedonistic, he is careless of obtaining the world from permissible\nmeans or forbidden means. This man asked, \"O Commander of the Faithful! What is the\nsign of a believer in such a time?\" He (AS) replied, \"He fulfils the obligations that Allah\nhas imposed upon him and he keeps away from what Allah has forbidden, regardless of\nhow much he yearns for it.\" The man asked, \"You are right, by Allah, O Commander of\nthe Faithful.\" Then the man disappeared, and we did not see him. So the people looked\nfor him, but did not find him. Ali (AS) smiled, while on the pulpit, and said: \"What is the\nmatter with you? That was my brother, al-Khidr (AS).\" The Imam (AS) then continues:\n\"Ask me before you are deprived of me.\" No one stood up to him. Hence, he praised\nAllah and extolled Him, and sent his blessings on the Prophet (SA). He then said to alHasan (AS), \"O Hasan, stand up and go up the pulpit and deliver a speech so that the\nQuraysh may not claim ignorance of you after me, otherwise they will say: \"Verily, alHasan ibn Ali knows nothing good.\" Al-Hasan (AS) said: \"O father! How can I go upon\nthe pulpit and speak when you are among the people listening and seeing?\"\nAli (ibn Abu Talib) said to him, \"May my father and mother be your ransom! I will\nconceal myself form you and will listen and see you while your cannot see me.\"\nAl-Hasan (AS) went up the pulpit, praised Allah profusely, and blessed the Prophet (SA)\nbriefly. He (AS) then said: \"O people, I have heard my grandfather the Messenger of\nAllah (SA) say: \"I am the City of Knowledge and Ali is its Gate. A city can only be\nentered by its gate.\" Then he (AS) came down. Ali (AS) leapt towards him, pulled him,\nand embraced him. Then he said to al-Husayn (AS), \"O my son! Stand up. Go to the\npulpit and deliver s speech so that the Quraysh cannot claim ignorance of you after me;\notherwise, they will say: \"Verily, al-Husayn ibn Ali has no vision. Your speech should\nbe subsequent to your brother's speech.\"\nAl-Husayn (AS) went up the pulpit, praised Allah profusely, and blessed the Prophet\n(SA) briefly. He (AS) then said: \"O Assembly! I heard my grandfather, the Messenger of\nAllah (SA) says: \"Verily, Ali is the City of Guidance. Whoever enters it is saved, and\nwhoever fails to enter it is lost.\"\nAli (AS) leapt towards him, embraced him, and kissed him. Then he (AS) said: \"O\nAssembly! Bear witness that these two are sons of the Messenger of Allah (SA) which\nhe has entrusted to my custody, and I am entrusting them to you. Beware O people, as\nthe Messenger of Allah (SA) will question you about them.\"",

He is the Highest of the High, who cannot be described in terms of\ntoughness. He preceded everything, so it cannot be said that something preceded Him.\nHe will remain forever, so it cannot be said that there shall be something after Him. He\nis the One that wills all things, but not through resolution. He is the MostAccomplishing, but not through deception. He is Present in all Things, but not\nphysically or through conflict. He is Manifest, but not in the sense of pursuit. He is\nEvident, but not by means of vision. He is Separate, but not by means of distance. He is\nClose, but not through attachment. He is Subtle, but not by means of a body. He is\nExistent not after nonexistence. He is the One who Accomplishes, but not by means of\ncompulsion. He is the Appraiser, but not by means of movement. He is the Intender, but\nnot through resolution.\nHe is the All-Hearing, but not by means of an auditory organ. He is All-Seeing, but not\nby a visual organ. Space does not encompass Him. Time does not escort Him.\nAttributes do not limit Him. Slumber seizes Him not. His Essence precedes time, and\nHis Being precedes nonexistence. His beginning its sempiternal.\nThrough His Formation of gatherings, it is known that He has no gathering. Through\nHis Creation of substances, it is known that He is not a substance. Through His\nCreation of opposites, it is known that He has no opposite. Through His Creation of\ncompanions, it is known that He has no consort. He made Light opposite of darkness,\ndryness opposite of moisture, and cold opposite of heat. He is the Composer of these\nopposites and the Differentiator between their closeness. This composition is an\nindication over the Composer and the differentiation over the Differentiator. That is the\nWord of the Mighty and High: And of everything We have created pairs that you may\nreflect.\nThus, He has differentiated through this between \"before\" and \"after\" so that it\nbecomes known that He has no before or after. Our instinct tells us instinctively that\nthe Giver of Instincts has no instinct. Our subjection to time tells us that the Creator of\nTime is not subjected to time. The veils that He has placed between some people tell us\nthat there is no veil between Him and His Creation. He was still a Lord when there was\nno one to rule over.

Abu al-Husayn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Ishaq al-Farisi said: Abu Said Ahmad ibn\nMuhammad ibn Rumayh al-Nisawi said: Ahmad ibn Jafar al-Aqili related to me in Quhistan\nthat Ahmad ibn Ali al-Balkhi related to me that Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Ali al-KhuzaiI\nsaid: Abd Allah ibn Jafar al-Azhari said, on the authority of his father, on the authority of\nJafar ibn Muhammad, on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn Ali, on the authority of his\nfather Ali ibn al-Husayn, on the authority of his father Al-Husayn (AS) that\nThe Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) said in some of his sermons:\n\"Who was present when Subakht the Persian had a word with the Messenger of Allah\nThe people said: \"None of us were present.\"\nSo Ali (AS) said: \"However, I was with him (AS) when Subakht came to him. He\nbelonged to Persian royalty, and was very sharp of mind. He asked: O Muhammad! To\nwhat do you call the people?'\nThe Prophet (SA) replied, \"I call people to witness that there is no god but Allah, the\nOne, the Only, without partners, and that Muhammad is His Servant, and His\nMessenger.\"\nSo Subakht asked, \"Where is Allah, O Muhammad?\"\nHe (SA) answered, \"He is present in every place by means of His Signs.\"\nHe asked, \"How is He?\"\nThe Prophet (SA) replied, \"He is not subject to quality nor space, because He, the\nMighty and High, created both quality and space.\"\nSubakht asked, \"Then where did He come from?\"\nHe (SA) replied, \"It cannot be said of Him that He came' since it refers to something\nthat moves form one place to another. Our Lord, however, is not subject to space or to\nmovement. In fact, He has always been without place and He never declines.\nThen he said: \"O Muhammad! Verily, you are describing your Great Lord without\nquality. Then how do I know that He has sent you?\"\nThere was nothing that surrounded us that day, of stone, pebble, mountain, tree or\nanimal, but that it professed: I bear witness that here is no god but Allah, and that\nMuhammad is His Servant, and His Messenger.'\nThus, I myself professed that I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that\nMuhammad is His Servant, and His Messenger.'\nSo Subakht asked, \"O Muhammad! Who is this?\"\nThe Prophet (SA) replied,\nThis (Ali ibn Abu Talib) is the best of my family, and the closest person to me in all of\ncreation. His flesh is my flesh. His blood is my blood. His spirit is my spirit. He is my\nsuccessor in my lifetime and the Caliph after my death. He is to me as Harun was to\nMusa, except that there will be no prophet after me.

Then they were directed to\nthe Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS), so they asked him (those\nquestions), and he answered them. Among the queries he was asked:\n\"Inform me about the Lord. Where is He, and where was He?\"\nAli (AS) replied,\nThe Lord, Exalted be His Glory, is not subject to space. He is how He was, and He was\nas He is now. He is not in any place, nor has He declined from one place to another. He\nis not encompassed in one place; rather, He has always been without boundary and\nwithout quality.\nThe Catholicos said: \"You have spoken the truth. Now tell me about the Lord. Is He in\nthis world or is He is the Hereafter?\"\nAli (AS) replied,\nOur Lord existed before this world existed, and He will exist forever. He is the Planner\nof this World, and the All-Knowing of the Hereafter. It is not possible for Him to be\nencompassed by this world or the Hereafter. However, He knows all that is in this\nworld, and all that is in the Hereafter.\nHe said: \"You have spoken the truth. May Allah have mercy on you!\" He then asked,\n\"Tell me about our Lord. Does He carry or is He carried?\"\nAli (AS), thus, replied, \"Verily, our Lord, Exalted be His Glory, carries and is not\ncarried.\"\nThe Christian asked, \"How is that? In the Bible we find that The Empyrean of your Lord\nis carried about them on the day by eight angels.\"\nAli (AS) answered,\nVerily, the angels carry the Empyrean. However, the empyrean is not shaped like a bed\nas you image. Rather, it is something bounder, crated, and planned, which is subjected\nto the Lord. It is not as if He is on it like something being carried by another. He has\nordered angels to carry it, and they do so with the power that he has granted them.\nThe Christian said: \"You have spoke the truth, May Allah have mercy on you!.\"\nThe Compiler of this book says: The Tradition is long. We have extracted from it the required\npassage. I have transmitted all of it in the end of the book Al-Nabuwwat.\n4. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar\nsaid, on the authority of Sahl ibn Ziyad, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Musa al-Khashshab, on\nthe authority of some of the ones he transmits from hurrying the transmission, that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) was questioned about the Word of Allah, the Mighty and\nHigh: The Most Compassionate is firm on the Empyrean, so he (AS) replied,\n\"He is equal in distance to everything. Therefore, He is not closer to one thing than\nanother.\"\n5. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: al-Husayn ibn al-Husayn ibn\nAban said, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Said, on the authority of al-Nadr ibn Suwayd, on\nthe authority of Asim ibn Humayd, on the authority of Abu Basir that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said: \"Whoever claims that Allah, the Mighty and High, is\nfrom something or in something or on something, then he has certainly disbelieved.\"\nI said: \"Explain that to me.\" He (AS) responded, \"I refer to a person who claims that He\nis contained by something, that He is restrained by something, or that He is preceded\nby something.\"\n6. And in another tradition it says\n\"Whoever claims that Allah is from something, he implies that He has been created.\nWhoever claims that He is in something, he implies that He is limited. And whoever\nclaims that He is on something, he implies that He is carried by something.\"\n7. Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil said: Abd Allah ibn Jafar said, on the authority of\nAhmad ibn Muhammad, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Mahbub that Maqatil ibn Sulayman\nrelated to me that\nI asked Jafar ibn Muhammad (AS) about the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: The\nMost Compassionate is firm on the Empyrean, so he (AS) replied, \"He is equal in\ndistance to everything.

Muhammad ibn Ali Majilwayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said, on the authority of his\npaternal uncle Muhammad ibn Abu al-Qasim, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Abu Abd Allah, on\nthe authority of his father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Sinan, on the authority of alMufaddal ibn Umar that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said:\nWhoever claims that Allah, the Mighty and High, is from something, in something, or on\nsomething, he has surely committed polytheism. \"He (AS) added, \"Whoever claims that\nAllah is from something, he implies that He is created. Whoever claims that Allah is\nfrom something, he implies that He is created. Whoever claims that He is in something,\nhe implies that He is limited. And whoever claims that He is on something, He has\nimplied that He is carried.\"\nThe Compiler of this book says: The anthropomorphist cling to the Word of the Mighty and\nHigh: Surely your Lord is Allah, who created heaves and the earth in six days, then\nestablished Himself upon the Empyrean; He throws the veil of night over the day, which\npursues it incessantly. There is no proof in that for them, because He, the Mighty and High,\nmeant by this: then established Himself upon the Empyrean, i.e. then He transferred the\nEmpyrean above the heavens, while He was in control over it and is its Master. His Word, the\nMighty and High: then' refers to raising the Empyrean to the place where it is and transferring\nit to a steady state. Thus, it is not possible for the word [istawa]' to mean taking possession,'\nbecause Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, taking possession over the sovereignty and all things\nis not an accidental matter. In fact, He has always been the Master of everything, and in\npossession of everything. Verily, He, the Mighty and High, has mentioned to establish' after\nusing the word then,' and that means to raise' metaphorically. It is similar to His Word: And\nmost certainly We will try you until We have known those among you who exert\nthemselves hard, and the patient. He has mentioned We have known' with His word until,'\nwhile He, the Mighty and High, means until the ones who exert exert.' We know this because\nuntil' is only used with an accidental action, while the knowledge of Allah, the Mighty and\nHigh, about the things is not accidental. Similar is the mention of His Word, the Mighty and\nHigh: established Himself upon the Empyrean' after His Word: then.' He means by that\nthen He raised the Empyrean for His Poss",

Verily, this world is an abode of tribulation and mischief. Everything that is init has a decline. Allah has informed us of that so that we may take a lesson. Therefore He preceded with a threat to us so that there is no evidence for us after warning. So be ascetic in what is to perish and desirous in what is to remain. Fear Allah in privacy and in open. Verily, Ali (AS) in life, death and the rising lived with a measure and died with the time. Verily, I shall accept your allegiance on that you will make peace with whom I make peace with and fight with whom I fight with.Thus, they all paid allegiance to him on that basis.\nMuhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn, the Compiler of this book says: The ajal is the death of a human and the time of his death. And the ajal of his living is the time of his living.

It is possible that if a murdered person was not killed, he would have died in that instance anyway. It is also possible that if he was not killed then he would have lived on.\nThe knowledge of that is unseen for us. Allah, the Mighty and High, has said; Say: Had you remained in your houses, those for whom slaughter was ordained would certainly have gone forth to the places where they would be slain.

For, it is possible that a disease would have occurred in all of them and would have killed them all in that instance. It is not possible to say that they all died without the time of their death.\nAs a whole, the ajal of a person is the time of his death that Allah, the Mighty and High, knows that he will die in that hour or will be killed.

    "Content": "32. Muhammad ibn Musa ibn al-Mutawakkil (RA) said: Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Sadabadi said: Ahmad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Barqi said, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Sinan, on the authority of Ziyad ibn al-Mundhar, on the authority of Sad ibn Tarif, on the authority of al-Asbagh ibn Nubatah that The Commander of the Faithful (AS) said the following concerning the decree: Beware that the decree is a secret from the secrets of Allah, concealment from the concealments of Allah, and a sanctuary from the sanctuaries of Allah. It is raised to the covering of Allah, folded up from the creation of Allah, sealed with the seal of Allah, and precedent in the knowledge of Allah. Allah has taken of its knowledge from the servants, raised it above their witnessing and level of intellect because they cannot attain it with the reality of the Lordship or the power of the Needless. Neither can they attain the greatness of the Light, nor the honor of the solitary, because it is an overflowing ocean purely for Allah, the Exalted. Its depth is between the heaven and the earth, and its width is between the east and the West. It is as dark as the pitch- dark night, full of snakes and fishes. It rises at one time ad drops at another. In its bottom, the sun shines. It ought to be that no one has its information except Allah the One, the Peerless. Thus, whoever becomes informed of I becomes contrary to Allah, the Mighty and High in His Judgement and contest Him in His Rule. He uncovers His Concealment and secret, and buys the anger of Allah. His abode is Hell, and it is the worst place of arrival. The Compiler of this book says, we believe: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has predestined and decreed the good and evil of His Servants, and all that is in the universe. The decree can be in the meaning of information, like Allah, the Mighty and High says: And We had decreed to the children of Israel in the Book. He means that We made known to them. Like Allah, the Mighty and High, says: And We revealed to him this decree, that the roots of these shall be cut off in the morning. He means that We informed him and made it known to him. Therefore, it cannot be refused that Allah the Mighty and High, decrees the actions of the servants and all that which is of good and evil in this meaning, because Allah, the Mighty and High, is the Knower of it all. It is correct that He may give knowledge to any of His servants and inform them of it. The decree can also be in the meaning of writing and informing, like Allah, the Mighty and High, says: Except his wife; We decreed that she shall surely be of those who remain behind; i.e. We prescribed and informed. Al-Ajjaj said: Be informed that the Glorified has decree In the earlier scriptures that He wrote. He decreed' means He wrote. The decree can sometimes be in the meaning of the rule and necessity. Allah, the Mighty and High, says: And your Lord has destined that you shall not serve (any) but Him, and goodness to your parents. He means that He has ordained that and made it necessary on His Creation. It may also be possible to say that Allah, the Mighty and High, has destined the actions of the servants in this meaning. What He made necessary for His Servants and ordered them to do are obligations. It is also possible that the meaning is: Allah has set a measurement for the actions of the servants to explain its measurements and states of good and evil, obligatory and supererogatory, and other things. He gives reasons fro what makes the states of these actions recognized. Therefore, the Mighty and High is the One that sets the measurements, but to explain them to other than Himself who do not know the state of what He has destined in their measurements. This is apparent and not hidden. It is very clear that it does not require any proofs over it. Is it not so that when we go to the skilled people in measurements, their knowledge of measurements does not stop them from setting measurements to explain to us their measurements? Verily, we reject that Allah, the Mighty and High, has ordained His Servants with this and forbidden them from abstention from this. Or that He has done it and created it. As Allah, the Mighty and High, has created them a measured creation, so we do not reject that. I heard some learned ones says: Verily, the destiny [al-Qada'] has ten different meanings: The first of them is to know' according to the Word of Alah, the Mighty and High: But (it was only) a desire in the soul of Yaqub which he destined, i.e. He knew. The second meaning is to inform' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And We had decreed to the children of Israel in the Book, and the Word of the Mighty and High: And We revealed to him this decree, i.e. We informed him. The third is to judge' according to the Word of the Mighty and High is: And Allah decrees with the truth, i.e. He judges with the truth. The fourth meaning is to say' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And Allah decrees with the truth, i.e. He says the truth. The firth is to determine definitely' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: But when We decreed death for him, i.e. We determined definitely. So I is the definite decree. The sixth is to command' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And your Lord has destined that you shall not serve (any) but Him, i.e. your Lord has commanded. The seventh is to create' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: So He decreed them seven heavens in two periods, i.e. he created them. The eight is to do' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Therefore, decree what you are going to decree, i.e. do what you are doing. The ninth is to accomplish' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: So when Musa had decreed the term; and the Word of the Mighty and High, accounting Musa Whichever of the two terms I decree, there shall be no wrongdoing to me; and Allah is a witness of what we say, i.e. I accomplish. The tenth is to conclude from something' according to the Word of the Mighty and High The matter is decreed concerning which you enquired, i.e. it is concluded from it for you two. It is the Word of a person what I have decreed your requirement for you, i.e. I have concluded it for you. Therefore, it is possible to say that the things in their entirety are with the destiny of Allah and His Decree, Blessed and Exalted be He. This is in the meaning that Allah, the Mighty and High, knows it and know it measures, and that He has a judgment for all of it, either the good or evil. Therefore, whatever is good He decreed it in the meaning that He commanded it, determined it definitely, and made it true. He knew its extent and measure. Whatever is evil, He did not command it, and is not pleased with it. However, He destined it, and decreed it in the sense that He knows its measure and extent, and has judged according to His Judgement. The word [al-fitnah] has ten different meanings: One of them is misguidance.' The second is to put to the test' according to the Word of Allah: And We tried you with (a severe) trying, i.e. We have put you to a test; and the Word of the Mighty and High: Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, We believe, and not be tried? i.e. they will not be put to a test. The third is to make excuse' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Then their excuse would be nothing but that they would say: By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists. The fourth is to believe in polytheism' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And polytheism is severer than murder. The fifth is to disbelieve' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Surely into trial have they already tumbled down, i.e. into disbelief. The sixth is to burn with fire' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Surely (as for) those who persecute the believing men and the believing women, i.e. they burn. The seventh is to punish' according the Word of the Mighty and High: (It is) the day on which they shall be tried at the fire, i.e. they shall be punished. The Word of the Mighty and High: Taste your trial! This is what you would hasten on, i.e. your punishment. And the Word of the Mighty and High: And as for him whose trial Allah desired, you cannot control anything fro him with Allah, i.e. whose punishment. The eight is to kill' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: If you fear that hose who disbelieve will cause you distress, i.e. if you fear that they will kill you. Also the Word of the Mighty and High: But none believed in Musa except the offspring of his people, on account of the fear of Firawn and their chiefs, lest he should persecute them, i.e. he may kill them. The ninth is to turn away' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And surely they had purposed to try you in that which We have revealed to you, i.e. to turn you away. The tenth is a severe trial' according to the Word of the Mighty and High: Our Lord! Do not make us a trial for those who disbelieve. And the Word of the Mighty and High is: Our Lord! Make us not subject to the persecution of the unjust people, i.e. a severe trial with which they may cause mischief. They say about themselves: Nothing has killed them except the fact that their religion is void, and our religion is true. Therefore, it invites them to Hell due to their disbelief and oppression. Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim has added to these ten meanings another possibility that one of the meanings of the word fitnah is love according to the Word of the Mighty and High: And know that your property and your children are a temptation, i.e. love. In my opinion, there are ten meanings to this verse. Fitnah is this context means a severe trial' and not love. The confirmation of that is the tradition of the Prophet (SA), \"The son, takes after the father in ignorance, trial and miserliness.\" I have extracted this tradition with transmission in the book Maqtal al-Husayn ibn Ali, blessings be upon them both.",

However, whoever raises or lowers prices will have to answer for that.\" The Compiler of this book says: Charging high prices is increasing the prices of things so much so that the thing is sold for more than what it would be sold for in that place. Lowering prices means to decrease the price. Therefore, whether the low or high prices are due to excess or shortage of commodities, it is from Allah, the Mighty and High, and it is obligatory for people to accept the prices and to be satisfied with them. If the high or low prices are caused by hoarding when there ws no shortage or excess of commodities, without the approval of the people, or because one person purchased all the food in the town in order to raise the price of food, then he is a price-fixer like Hakim ibn Hizam who used to buy all the food that entered Medina. The Prophet (SA) passed by him and said: \"O Hakim ibn Hizam! Beware of hoarding.\"",

However, if there is food or merchandise other than it, then there is no problem in owning any excess commodity. If there was a rise in price in such a circumstance form Allah, the Mighty and High, then the buyer of all the food of the town does not deserve blame, because Allah, the Mighty and High, does not blame a servant over his action. This is why the Messenger of Allah (SA) has said: The importer is blessed and the hoarder is cursed.' If it is from the Mighty and High, then it is obligatory to be satisfied with it and accept it. Similarly it is obligatory when it is due to shortage of things or shortage of income, because that is from Allah, the Mighty and High. What is from Allah, the Mighty and High, or is from the people, is from previous in the knowledge of Allah, Exalted be His remembrance.

Hence, he (SA) replied, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is more adequate for them. When the Day of Judgment comes and Allah, the Mighty and High, assembles creation to deliver His Judgment. He will bring forth the children of the monotheists, and will ask them: \"O My Servants! Who is your Lord? What is your religion? And what deeds have you brought forth?\" They will reply: \"O our Allah, our Lord, You created us, while we did no create anything. You made us die, while we did not make anything die. However, You did no make our tongues speak, nor our ears hear, nor did you give us a Book to guide us or send us a messenger to follow. We know nothing more than what You have taught us.\" The Mighty and High will reply to them: \"O My Servants! If I gave you an order, would you follow it?\"\" They will say: \"O our Lord, listening and obedience belongs to You.\" The reporter says: he (SA) said: Allah, the Mighty and High, will command a fire from Hell, called al-Falaq, which is the most severe in punishment in Hell. Thus, it will come out of its place, black, darkened, and covered with chains and shackles. Allah, the Mighty and High, will command it to blow in the face of creation, and it will blow. As a result of the blow, the heaven will be covered, the starts will be obliterated, the oceans will freeze, the mountains will crumble, the vision will be impeded, pregnant women will miscarry, and the hair of children will turn grey out of horror on the Day of Judgment. Then Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, will command the children of the monotheists to cast themselves into that fire. Thus, whoever was privileged in the Knowledge of Allah, the Mighty and High, from before will cast themselves into the fire. The fire, however, will become cool for them, and a source of safety, as it was for Ibrahim (AS). Those whomever Allah, the Mighty and High, knows to be adverse, however, will refuse to throw themselves into the fire. Hence, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, will command the fire to gather them for failing to heed Allah's command, and for refusing to enter the fire. As a result they will be in Hell in succession to their forefathers. Such is the Word of the Mighty and High: Then (some) of them shall be unhappy and (others) happy. So as to those who are unhappy, they shall be in the fire; for them shall be sighting and groaning in it: Abiding therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord please; surely your Lord is the Mighty Doer of what He does.

    "Content": "12. And with the same chain of transmission: on the authority of Hammad ibn Uthman, on the authority of Amir ibn Abd Allah that Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said, On the grave of Ibrahim, son of the Messenger of Allah (SA), there was a branch that shaded it from sunlight. By the time the branch dried up, the marks of the grave had vanished and its place was not know. He (AS) also added, When Ibrahim, son of the Messenger of Allah (SA) died, he was eighteen months old. Therefore, Allah, the Mighty and High, had his suckling period completed in Paradise. The Compiler of this book says concerning children and their state: Verily, the process of recognizing justice and injustice, and the way of differentiation between the two or aversion from them, is not something innate. In fact, it is due to the approval or disapproval of the intellect. Therefore, it is not permissible for us to refuse the evil of an action due to our ignorance of its causes. Nor should we take it out from the boundary of justice based on its apparent from. Rather the method, when we intend to understand the reality of a category of actions that is hidden to us, should be the rational one. We should turn to proofs that indicate the wisdom of their doers, and we should be devoted to proofs that introduce us to the state of its doer. If He acts wisely and justly, then it must necessarily apply to all of His actions, whether or not we are ignorant of their causes. This is because, as far as the intellect is concerned, there is no shortcoming in one category of actions without the other, or specification for one genus without the other. Take the case of a father, for example, who we know to be just. If he amputates a limb from his son for a reason that we are ignorant of, we cannot declare that he is unjust since we are unaware of the reason for which he did so. As a whole, this is due to his fair appearance and good intent for his son. The actions of Allah, the All-Knowing of the ends and beginnings, are similar, Blessed and Exalted be Hi. Reason requires us to believe that His Actions must be wise and just. We cannot limit ourselves to what we know because we are ignorant of all the details which motivate His Actions. We understand that we are unable to understand the causes of all things, since we do not understand them in full. This is when we intend to understand a sentence that enables its ignorance from the rules of His Actions, the Mighty and High. However, if we intend to explore its meanings and discuss its causes then we are not short of intellects, with the praise of Allah, that may make us recognize the rational reasoning in their details, what confirms the indication on a whole. The proof that the actions of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, are based on wisdom is that they are far form contradiction and secure from differentiation. The proof can also be found in their interconnectedness, the need of things to their likes, and the damaging of its shape and connecting of every category to its resemblance until it is imagined that it is other than what is seems. The rotation of the heavens and the movement of the sun and the moon, and the travel of the stars would certainly obliterate and be destroyed. Thus, when the actions of Allah, the Mighty and High, execute what we have mentioned regarding the reasons for justice and injustice, we can only conclude that they are based on wisdom. The proof the Mighty and High does not oppress can be found in the fact hat He, Blessed and Exalted, is Eternal, Self-Sufficient, and All-Knowing. Furthermore, He cannot act ignorantly. Oppression only occurs among the ignorant or those who seek personal benefit. Since He, the Blessed and Exalted, is Eternal and Self-Sufficient, He does not benefit or lose anything fro knowing what was, and what will be good and evil. Everything He does is out of wisdom, and everything He does is Right. Do you to see that those who are wise do not commit evil, as he has sufficient self-control to refrain from evil. Whoever commits a major sin deserves criticism. Therefore, the existence of evil is not feared from Him and this is clear. All praise is due to Allah.",

Some children are born dead. Some are miscarried. Some are born deaf or dumb. Some die the hour they are born. Some die at puberty. And some live until they reach old age. Why is that? And what is the cause?\" Thus, he (AS) replied, Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is the Best of Planners when it comes to the affairs of His Creation.

And whoever he allows to reach old age, He bestows upon him what was (allocated) to him. He gives out of favor and prohibits due to Justice. He is not questioned about what He does, yet people will be questioned about what they do. Jabir says: I asked him, \"O son of the Messenger of Allah!

He used to research Islam, and sought to debate those Muslims who\nwere familiar with the Christian gospels, and who were familiar with the Messiah,\nhis attributes, arguments, and signs.\nHe says: He had been known for that until he became famous among the Christians,\nMuslims, Jews, and Zoroastrians. The Christians use to be so proud of him that they\nwould say: \"If there was no one on earth in the Christian faith except Burayhah that\nwould suffice us.\" He was seeker of the truth and with that, of Islam. He had a woman\n292\nwith him that used to serve him and she had been with him for a long time. He use to\nsecretly tell her about the weakness of Christianity and its weak proofs.\nHe said: I came to know that from him.\nThus, Burayhah put this matter behind him, and approached the various Muslim\nschools who differed a bout Islam, in search of the most learned one among them. He\ncame asking about the Muslim leaders, their pious one, their scholars, and t heir\nleading intellectuals.\nHe examined every Muslim school of though, and found nothing that satisfied him.\nHe said: \"If you leaders were on the true path, then they would have some truth with\nthem!\" Finally, he learned about the Shiites from Hisham ibn al-Hakam.\nYunus ibn Abd al-Rahman says: Hisham said to me.\nI was sitting in my shop at the door of al-Karkh while a group of people were reciting\nthe Qur'an to me. I was suddenly taken aback by a group of Christian clergymen. There\nwere approximately one hundred men, dressed in the black clothing and chasubles (of\nthe Coptic priests) and the Great Catholicos. Burayhah was among them.\nThey came down around my shop and placed a chair for Burayhah to sit on. The\nbishops and monks stood learning over their staffs, and on their heads were their\nchasubles. Burayhah addressed me and said: \"I have exhausted every single Muslim\ntheologian in debate regarding Christianity, and they had nothing that impressed me.\nHence, I have come to you wishing to debate Islam.\"\nHe says: Hisham laughed and said: \"O Burayhah! If you expect me to give you the\nsame type of signs that he Messiah gave, you have come to the wrong place as I am not\nthe Messiah, not even close. I would never critics him, though, as he was one of the\npurified ones, who was humble in character, yet sublime in spirituality. The Signs of\nAllah wee manifest in him.\"\nBurayhah responded, \"Your words astonish me.\"\nHisham said: \"If you want to argue then go ahead.\"\nBurayhah said: \"Yes. I certainly want to question you: What is the physical tie between\nyour Prophet and the Messiah?'\"\nHisham replied, \"He is the son of his maternal grandfather, because Jesus is from the\nchildren of Ishaq, and Muhammad (SA) is from the children of Ismail.\"\nBurayhah asked,\nHow do you relate him to his father?\"\nHisham answered, \"If you want his lineage from your view, I will inform you of it, and if\nyo want his linage according to us, I will inform you of that.\"\nBurayhah enquired, \"I want his lineage according to us.\" Burayhah says that I was\nthinking that if he described his lineage according to us, I would overpower him. So I\nsaid: \"Describe his lineage the way we relate it.\"\nHisham explained, \"Yes. You say: \"He is without beginning from the one without\nbeginning. Then who is the Father and who is the Son?\"\nBurayhah said: \"He who came unto the Earth is the Son.\"\nHisham asked, \"He who came unto the Earth is the Father.\"\nHe said: \"The Son is the messenger of the Father.\"\nHisham added, \"Verily, the Father is wiser than the Son, because the Father is the\nCreator.\"\nBurayhah said: \"Verily, the Father and the Son are both the Creators.\"\nHisham continued, \"What prevented them from coming down to Earth together like they\nwere together when they created the world?\"\nBurayhah replied, \"How do they associate while they are both one thing? They differ\nonly by name.\"\nHisham responded, \"Verily, they unite with the name.\"\nBurayhah said: \"This statement is unknown.\"\n293\nHisham said: \"This statement is well-known,\"\nBurayhah responded, \"Verily, the Son is connected to the Father.\"\nHisham replied, \"Verily, the Son is disconnected from the Father.\"\nHe replied, \"This is contrary to what the people would think.\"\nHisham explained, \"If what the people think is true, then I have overcome you for the\nFather was when the Son was not. Is that what you are saying, O Burayhah?\"\nHe answered, \"I do not say this.\"\nHisham responded, \"Then why did you seek to confirm your beliefs on the beliefs of\nthose whom you reject?\"\nHe said: \"Verily, the Father is a name and the Son is a name, and the eternal has\ndecreed them.\"\nHisham said: \"Are the two names without beginning? Are they eternal like the Father\nand the Son?\nBurayhah declared, \"No, The names are accidental (ones with beginning.)\"\nHe responded, \"You have certainly made the Father a Son, and the Son a Father. If the\nSon brought these names about, and not the Father, then he is the Father. And if the\nFather brought these names about, and not the Son, then he is the Father, and the Son\nis the Father. Thus, there is no Son here.\"\nBurayhah said: \"Verily, the Son is a name of the Holy Spirit when it came down to the\nEarth.\"\nHisham responded, \"What was its name prior to coming down to Earth?\"\nBurayhah continued on, baffled: \"Its name is the Son whether it came down or did not\ncame down.\"\nHisham advocated, \"So before the coming down of this Spirit, it was all one but it had\ntwo names.\"\nHe said: \"It is all one; one Spirit.\"\nHisham acclaimed, \"You are pleased to make some of it the Son and some of it the\nFather.\"\nBurayhah replied, \"No, because the name of the Father and the name of the Son are\none.\"\nHisham said: \"Therefore, the Son is the Father of the Father, and the Father is Father of\nthe Son, and there is one Son.\"\nThe bishops said to Burayhah with one voice: \"Nothing like this has ever happened to\nyou, stand up!\"\nThus, Burayhah was confused and wanted to leave, so Hisham attached and said:\nWhat prevents you from embracing Islam? Is there any rancour in your heart? Then say\nit, otherwise I will ask you a question about Christianity. I will give you the night to think\nabout it. Then, when you wakeup, you will only be interested in me.\nThe bishops said: \"Do not ask him the question, for it may create doubts about your\nfaith.\"\nBurayhah said: \"Say it, O father of al-Hakam.\"\nHisham went on, \"Tell me, does the Son know everything that the Father does?\"\nHe answered, \"Yes.\"\nHisham asked, \"Tell me, does the Father know everything that is with the Son?\"\nHe answered, \"Yes.\"\nHisham asked, \"Tell me, does the Son have power over everything that the Father has\npower over?\"\nHe answered, \"Yes.\"\nHisham asked, \"Tell me, does the Father have power over everything which the Son has\npower over?\"\nHe answered, \"Yes.\"\n294\nHisham responded, \"Then how can one of them be the Son of his partner, while they\nare both equal, and how does each one of them oppress his partner?\"\nBurayhah said; \"There is no oppression between them.\"\nHisham continued, \"The truth between them is that the Son is the Father of the Father,\nand the Father is the Son of the Son. Spend the night thinking about this, O Burayhah.\"\nThe Christians dispersed, and they were wishing that they had never seen Hisham and\nhis friends.\nYunus ibn Abd al-Rahman says: Burayhah returned in grief and anxiety till he reached\nhis home. The woman that served him asked him, \"Why is it that I see you grieved and\nanxious/\" Hence, he related to her the debate between Hisham and him. She asked,\n\"Woe unto you! Do you want to follow truth or falsehood?\"\nBurayhah replied, \"Truth, of course.\"\nShe said to him, \"Wherever you find truth, then turn to it. Be careful of obstinacy. For\nverily, obstinacy is doubt, doubt is calamity, and those with doubt are in Hell.\"\nThe reporter says: He agreed with her statement and decided to go to Hisham the next\nmorning. The next morning he went to Hisham when none of his companions were with\nhim. He enquired, \"O Hisham! Do you have someone whose views and words you turn\nto, and profess his obedience?\"\nHisham answered, \"Yes, O Burayhah.\"\n\"What is his description?\"\n\"Are you asking about his lineage or his religion?\" Hisham replied,\nHe said: \"Both of them, the description of his lineage and his religion.\"\nHisham responded,\nAs for his lineage, it is the best of the lineages: He is the leader of the Arabs, the best of\nthe Quraysh, and the most distinguished of the Hashimites. Whoever argued about his\nlineage always found it to be better than his own, because the Quraysh are the best of\nthe Arabs, and the Hashimites are the best of the Quraysh. And, as he is the best of the\nHashimites, he is the most pious among them, and their master. He descends from the\nchildren of the master, who are better than all other children. He is the son of the\nmaster.\nHe said: \"Describe his religion.\"\nHisham said: \"His law or description of body and his purity?\"\nHe said: \"Describe his body and his purity/\"\nHisham described,\nHe is infallible; thus, he does not sin. He is generous; hence, he does not act miserly.\nHe is brave; so he does not act cowardly. He has been bestowed with knowledge;\ntherefore, he does not act ignorantly. He is the Protector of the Religion, firm in what is\nmade mandatory. He is from the Progeny of the Prophets (AS), and the Vessel of\nProphetic Knowledge (AS). He pardons when he is angry. He is fair in times of\noppression. He helps when pleased, and is just towards both friend and foe. He does\nnot ask of deviation for his enemy and foes not prohibit benefiting his friends. He\npractices the Book and speaks wonders. He is one of the Purified Ones. He relates the\nwords of the Divinely Elected Leaders without violating their Proof. He is not ignorant\nof any question. He can derive a ruling [fatwa] from any tradition, and makes clear all\ndarkness.\nBurayhah responded, \"You have described the Messiah in his attributes, and proved\nhim by his proofs and signs, except that you have applied this description to another\nperson. If there is a person who fits this description, we will believe in him.\"\nHisham said: \"If you believe you will be guided, and if you follow the truth you will not\nbe blamed.\" He then added, \"O Burayhah! There is not a proof which Allah establishes\nover the first of His Creation, except that He establishes it over the middle creation and\n295\nthe last creation. Therefore, Proofs do not become invalidated, just like nations and\npractices do not disappear.\"\nBurayhah admitted, \"How close is this to righteousness, and how near it is to the\ntruth. This is the attribute of the wise. They establish proof that negates suspicion.\"\nHisham said: \"Yes.\"\nThen they both departed together until they arrived at Medina. The woman was with\nthem. They both wanted to see Abu Abd Allah (AS). However, they met Musa ibn Jafar\n(AS), so Hisham related to him the account. When he finished, Musa ibn Jafar (AS)\nsaid: \"O Burayhah! How is your knowledge of your Book (the bible)?\"\nHe answered, \"I am knowledgeable of it.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked, \"How is your faith in its interpretation?\"\nHe replied. \"I am confident that I am knowledgeable about it.\"\nThe reporter says: Musa ibn Jafar (AS) began reading the Bible. Burayhah responded,\n\"The Messiah must have read like this, and no one has read this recitation but the\nMessiah.\"\nBurayhah then said: \"I have been seeking you or someone like you for the past fifty\nyears.\"\nThe reporter says: Therefore, he embraced Islam and so did the woman, and both were\nexpediently faithful. The Hisham, Burayhah, and the woman entered the presence of\nAbu Abd Allah (AS). Hisham related the account and the discussion that took place\nbetween Musa (AS) and Burayhah.\nThus Abu Abd Allah (AS) read: Offspring one of the other; and Allah is Hearing,\nKnowing.\nSo Burayhah asked, \"May I be your ransom! How do you view the Torah, the Bible and\nthe Books of the Prophets?\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) replied: \"We are their Heirs. We read them the way they were\noriginally read, and we convey them as they were originally conveyed. Verily, Allah\ndoes not place a Proof [hujjat] on His earth who, when questioned about something,\nanswers: I do not know.'\"\nHence, Burayhah remained with Abu Abd Allah (AS) until Abu Abd Allah passed away.\nThen he remained with Musa ibn Jafar (AS) until Burayhah died in his time. The Imam\n(AS) washed his corpse with his own hands, shrouded his body, and placed him in the\ngrave and said: \"This is a disciple from the disciples of the Messiah, who recognized\nthe right of Allah over him.\"\nThe reported says: Thus, most of the Companions of the Imam (AS) wished they were\nlike him.\n296\nChapter Thirty-Eight: Dhikr Azamat Allah, jalla Jalalahu. The\nRemembrance of Allah's Greatness, Mighty be His Glory - 11\ntraditions\n1. My father (may Allah have mercy on them) said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said: Ibrahim ibn\nHashim and others said, on the authority of Khalaf ibn Hammad, on the authority of al-Husayn\nibn Zayd al-Hashimi, that\n2\nk\nk\nk k\n297\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said:\nZaynab, the squint-eyed perfume lady, came to the wives of the Messenger of Allah\n(SA) and his daughters. The Messenger of Allah (SA) entered when she was with them.\nSo he (SA) said to her, \"When you visit us our houses are filled with perfume.\"\nHence, she replied, \"Your house is the most pleasant due to your own scent, O\nMessenger of Allah.\"\nHe (SA) said: \"When you sell, then be good. However, do not engage in deceptive\nmarketing for that is not a good practice for ensuring wealth.\"\nShe responded, \"I did no come with something to sell. Verily, I came to ask you about\nht Greatness of Allah.\"\nThus, he (SA) said: \"Glory be to Allah! Let me share His Greatness with you.\"\nThe reporter says: then he (SA) continued,\nVerily, the planet earth and everything it contains is like a ring in the vastness of the desert to the one which is below it. The earth and the one below it, and everything they\ncontain, are like a ring in the vastness of the desert to the one that is below them. This\nhow they are until it reaches the seventh one.\nThen he recited this verse: Allah is He who created seven heavens, and the Earth the\nlike of them.\nThe seven heavens and whatever they contain are on the back of a rooster like a ring in\nthe open desert. The rooster has two wings; one in the East and the other in the West, and\nits feet are on the borderline. The seven heavens, the rooster, and whatever they\ncontain, are on a rock like a ring in the open desert. The seven heavens, the rooster, the\nrock, and the fish are in a dark ocean like a ring in the open desert. The seven heavens,\nthe rooster, the rock, the fish, and the dark ocean are in the air like a ring in the open\ndesert. The seven heave ns, the rooster, the rock, the fish, the dark ocean, and the air\nare beneath the ground like a ring in the open desert.\nThen he (SA) recited this verse: His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth,\nand what is between them two, and what is beneath the ground.\nThen the tradition stopped.\n298\nThe seven heavens, the rooster, the rock, the fish, the dark ocean, the air, the ground, and\nwhatever is in them are in heaven like a ring in the open desert.\nAll of these things, the heaven of this world, and whatever is in them, are like a ring in\nthe open desert. All of these things and the two heavens are like a ring in the open\ndesert compared to the third heaven. The third heaven and whatever is in it is like a\nring in the open desert compared to the fourth heaven, and so on until the seventh\nheaven.\nThese seven heavens and whatever is in them are like a ring in the open desert\ncompared to the ocean which covers the earth. The seven heavens, and the ocean\nwhich covers the earth, are like a ring in the open desert compared to the mountain.\nThen he (AS) read this verse: And He sends down from heavens (clouds like)\nmountains laden with hail.\nThese seven heavens, the covered ocean and the mountain are like a ring in the open\ndesert compared to the veils of light. There are seventy thousand of these blinding veils\nlight. The seven heavens, the covered oceans, the mountains, and the veils are like a\nring in the open-spaced desert in comparison to the air, in which the hearts are fervent.\nThen he (AS) read this verse His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and\nthe preservation of them both tires Him not, and He is the Most High, the Great.\nThe seven heavens, the covered oceans, the mountains, the veils, the air, and the\nThrone are like a ring in the open desert compared to the Empyrean.\nThen he (AS) read this verse: The Most Compassionate Allah is Firm on the Empyrean.\nThe angels cannot carry it except with the statement \"there is no god but Allah\" and\n\"there is no power and no strength save in Allah.\"\n2. My father (RA) said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said: Muhammad ibn Isa said, on the authority of\nal-Hasan ibn Mahbub, on the authority of Amr ibn Shimr, on the authority of Jabir ibn Yazid\nthat\nI asked Abu Jafar al-Baqir (AS) about the Word of the Mighty and High: He (AS) said:\nO Jabir! After Allah, the Mighty and High, destroys this creation, placing the people of\nParadise in Paradise, and the people of Hell in Hell, He will recreate another world\ndifferent from this one without men or women, to serve Him and profess His Unity. He\nwill create for them an earth different form this one. And He will create for them a\nfirmament different from the earth to give them shade. Perhaps you think that Allah\nonly created this world, and that Allah has not created other beings than you. No,\ncertainly not. Allah has created millions of worlds, and millions of human creations.\nAnd you re the last of those worlds, and the last of those beings.\n3. Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qittan said: Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Zakariyya said: Bakr ibn Abd\nAllah ibn Hubayb said, on the authority of Tamim ibn Buhlul, on the authority of Nasr ibn\nMuzahim al-Minqari, on the authority of Amr ibn Sad, on the authority of Abu Mikhnaf Lut ibn\nYahya, on the authority of Abu Mansur, on the authority of Zayd ibn Wahab that\n2\n300\nThe Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abu Talib was asked about the Omnipotence of\nAllah, Exalted and Glorified be He. Therefore, he (AS) stood up, delivered a sermon\npraising and exalting Allah. He then said:\nVerily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has created angels that are so enormous that\nthey cannot fly down to the earth due to the sheer size of their numerous wings. Among\nthem is an angel that is so huge that even if jinn and humankind worked together to\ndescribe him, they would be unable to do so due to the distance between its joints and\nthe beauty of its composed image.\nHow can one be described which has seven hundred years of distance between its\nshoulders and its earlobes? Among them is one who obstructs the horizon with one of\nits many wings without the complete enormity of its body. Among them is one who is\nso tall that the heavens merely reach his waist. And among them is one whose feet\nfloat in the atmosphere and its knees reach the earth. There is also an angel who is so\nhuge that all of the water on earth would fit in the cavity of his thumb. There is also one\nwho is so hug that if ships were cast into the tears of its eyes, they could sail for the rest\nof eternity. Blessed is Allah, the Best of the Creators.\nHe (AS) was questioned about the veils, so he answered,\nThe first of the veils are seven in number. The thickness of each veil is five hundred\nyears of travel. And the distance between the two veils is the distance traveled in five\nhundred years. The third veil is composed of seventy veils. Between each veil is the\ndistance traveled in five hundred years. The length of each veil is five hundred years of\ntravel.\nThere are seventy thousand angels acting as the gatekeepers for every veil. The\nstrength of each one of these angels is equal to the strength of all the jinn and men.\nThey are the source of darkness, light, fire, smoke, clouds, lightning, rain, thunder,\nglow, sand, mountain, dust, water and all rivers. There are different veils. The\nthickness of each one of these veils is the distance traveled over the course of seventy\nthousand years.\nThen there are the Canopies of Glory [jalal], and there are seventy such canopies. In\neach canopy there are seventy angels. Between each canopy is the distance traveled\nduring five hundred years.\nThen there is the Canopy of Mighty [izz]; then the Canopy of Pride [kibriya]; then the\ncanopy of Greatness [azamah]; then the Canopy of Sacredness [qudus]; then the\nCanopy of Power [jabarut]; and then the Canopy of Pride [fakhr]. Then is the white\nlight, then the Canopy of Oneness [wahdaniyah], which spans the distance traveled\nover seventy thousand years into seventy thousand years; and then there is the Most\nSublime Veil.\nHence, his (AS) speech ended and he became silent.\nTherefore, Umar said to him (AS), \"I do not want to remain for a day when I do not see\nyou, O Father of al-Hasan.\"\n4. Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Abd Allah ibn Ahmad al-Aswari said: Makki ibn Ahmad ibn Sadwayh\nal-BurdhaI said: Uday ibn Ahmad ibn abd al-Baqi Abu Umayr reported to us in Adhanah\nthat Abu al-Hasan Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Bura' said: Abd al-Munim ibn Idris said: My\nfather related to me, on the authority of Wahab, on the authority of Ibn Abbas that\n301\n2  .\nThe Prophet (SA) said: Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has create a rooster\nwhose feet are on the borderline of the lowly seventh earth, while its head is in the\nEmpyrean, and its neck is twisted below the Empyrean. It is an angel among the angels\nof Allah, the Mighty and High. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has placed its feet at the\nlowest level of the seventh earth. It crosses the earths, to the end of the earths, until it\ncomes out at the horizon of heaven. Then it passes the horizon until its first visible part\nreaches the Empyrean, while it says: \"Glory be to You, my Lord.\"\nVerily, this rooster has two wings. If it would spread them out, they would cross both\nthe East and the West. When it is the end of the night, it spreads its two wings, shakes\nthem, and it calls out with the glorification that \"Glory be to Allah, the Sovereign, the\nMost Holy. Glory be to the Great, the Supreme Being [al-mutal], the Most Holy. There is\nno god but He, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsistent.\"\nWhen it says so then all the roosters of the earth glorify, spread their wings, and begin\nto crow. And when that rooster becomes still then the rooster on the earth become still.\nAt the time of dawn, it spreads its two wings, which cross the East and the West, and\nshakes them, and calls out with the glorification: \"Glory be to Allah, the Great. Glory\nbe to Allah, the Honorable, the Subduer. Glory be to Allah, the Possessor of the Glorious\nEmpyrean. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the Lofty Empyrean.\"\nWhen it does that then all the roosters of the earth do their glorification. Therefore, it\nwakes the rooster of the earth, who awake and answer its glorification of Allah, the\nMighty and High. The rooster ahs the purest white feathers I have ever seen. Below its\nwhite feathers it has the darkest green fuzz that I have ever seen. I am still longing to\nlook at the feathers of that rooster.\n5. With the same chain of transmission that\n302\nThe Prophet (SA) said:\nVerily, among the angels of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is an angel whose upper\nhalf is composed of fire, while its lower half is composed of ice. Neither does the fire\nmelt ice, nor does the ice extinguish the fire. He stands calling with his high-pitched\nvoice: \"Glory be to Allah, who withholds the heat of this fire so that it does not melt this\nice; and Glory be to Allah who withholds the coldness of this ice so that it does not\nextinguish this fire. O Allah! O Combiner of the Ice and fire! Unite the hearts of Your\nBelieving Servants in Your Obedience.\"\n6. With the same chain of transmission that\nThe Prophet (SA) said:\nVerily, among the angels of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, are angels who glorify\nAllah, the Mighty and High, with the entirety of their beings, praising Him in every\ndirection with different voices. They do not lift their heads to heaven, nor do they lower\nthem to their feet from crying and fear of Allah, the Mighty and High.\n7. Muhammad ibn Musa al-Mutawakkil (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Abu Abd Allah al-Kufi said,\non the authority of Musa ibn Imran al-NakahI, on the authority of his paternal uncle alHusayn ibn Yazid, on the authority of Ismail ibn Muslim that Abu Rahman ibn Abu Dharr, on\nthe authority of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (may the mercy of Allah be upon him) that\nI was holding the hand of the Prophet (SA) and we were both walking. We were looking\nat the sun and until it set, So I asked, \"O Messenger of Allah! Where does it set?\"\n[(Editor's footnote: This traditionis strange (gharib). As they do not agree with scientific\nfact, the words that follow cannot be attributed to the Prophet (SA)]\nHe (SA) replied,\nThe sun sets in the sky then it rises from the sky to another sky, until it rises to the\nseventh highest sky, which is below the Empyrean. Then, the sun prostrates, and the\nangels which are entrusted with it prostrate themselves along with it. At this point, the\nsun says: \"O my Lord! Do you command me to rise from the West or from my place of\nrising (the East)?\" According to the Word of the Exalted: Abd the sun runs onto a term\nappointed for it; that is the ordinance of the Mighty, the Knowing. What He means is\nthat He, the Mighty Lord, knows the Realm He has created.\nHe said: Then Jibrail comes to the sun with a dress which glows with the Light of the\nEmpyrean and fixes the times of day, making them lengthy during the summer, short\nduring the winter, and intermediate length during the call and spring. He said: Thus, the\nsun wears that dress like anyone of you wear your dress, then it brightens up with it the\nhorizon of the heaven until it rises from the place of rising.\nThe Prophet (SA) said: It is as if I am looking at it, and it is confined for three nights,\nthen it dresses with the glow, and is commanded to rise from the West. That is the\nWord of the Mighty and High: When the sun is covered, and when the starts darken.\nThe moon is similar in its place of rising, and its trajectory in the horizon of heaven. Its\nsetting is it is rising to the seventh heaven. It prostrates below the Empyrean then\nJibra'il comes to it with a dress of light from the Throne. According to the Word of the\nMighty and High He made the sun a shinng brightness and the moon a light.\nAbu Dharr (RA) says: \"I then withdrew with the Messenger of Allah (SA) and we prayed\nthe Maghrib prayers.\n304\n8. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar (RA) said: My father said: al-Husayn ibn alHasan ibn Aban related to us, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Auramah, o the authority of\nZiyad ibn al-Qandi, on the authority of Durust, on the authority of a man that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) said:\n\"Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has created an angel who is so huge that it\nwould take a fluttering bird five hundred years to fly from its earlobe to its neck.\"\n9. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: Ahmad ibn Idris said, on the\nauthority of Muhammad ibn Ahmad, on the authority of al-Sayyari, on the authority of Abd\nAllah ibn Hammad, on the authority of Jamil ibn Durraj that\nI asked Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS). \"Are there oceans in heaven?\"\nHe replied,\nYes. My father related to me, on the authority of his father, and he on the authority of\nhis grandfather (AS) that the Messenger of Allah (SA) said:\nVerily, in the seven heavens there are oceans, the depths of which are like the distance\ntraveled over the course of five hundred years. In them are angels who have been\nstanding in service since they were created by Allah, the Mighty and High. The water\nbarely reaches their knees. There is not an angel among them but that he has fourteen\nhundred wings. On each wing, there are four faces. On each face there are four\ntongues. And there is no a single wing or a single tongue or a single mouth but this it\nglorifies Allah, the Mighty and High, with a glorification that does not resemble in any\nway the prayers of the others.\n10. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Walid (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar\nsaid, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn al-Hasan ibn Aban, on the authority of Muhammad ibn\nAuramah, on the authority of Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Maythami, on the authority of Abu alHasan al-Sharif, on the authority of Sad ibn Tarif; on the authority of Asbagh ibn Nubatah\nthat\n305\n. \nIbn al-Kawwa' came to the Commander of the Faithful (AS) and said: \"O Commander of\nthe Faithful! By Allah, verily there is a verse in the Book of Allah, the Mighty and High, that\nhas destroyed my heart, making me doubt my religion.\"\nAli (AS) said to him, \"May your mother be bereaved of you and be deprived of you!\nWhat is that verse?\"\nHe replied, \"The Word of Allah, the Exalted: The birds with expanded wings, each\nknows its own prayer, and its own glorification.\"\nImam Ali (AS) responded,\nO son of al-Kawwa'! Verily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has created angels in\ndifferent shapes. There is an angel of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, in the shape of a\nrooster, which is hoarse and gray. Its talons are in the seventh lowly earth and its dual\ncomb is below the Empyrean. It has two wings; one in the East and the other in the\nWest. One is of fire and the other is of ice.\nWhen the time of prayer comes, it stands on its talons and raises its neck from below\nthe Empyrean, and then it flaps its two wings like the roosters in your houses do.\nNeither the one that is from fire melts the ice, nor does the one form the ice put out the\nfire. At that point it calls:\nI bear witness that there is no got but Allah, He Alone, there is no associate with Him; and I\nbear witness that Muhammad is the Master of the Prophets and his successor is the\nMaster of the Successors and that Allah is the Most Praised, the Most Holy, Lord of\nthe Angels and the Spirit (Ruh).\nHe said: Then the roosters in your homes flap their wings and answer him in his call,\nand that is the Word of the Exalted: The birds with expanded wings, each knows its\nown prayer and its own glorification\" from the roosters in the earth.\n306\n11.

Allah is\nthe Needless and the first few verses from the Chapter \"the Iron\" until He says: And He\nis Cognizant of what is in the hearts. Thus whosoever goes beyond that is ruined.\n3.

Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: Muhammad ibn al-Hasan alSaffar said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid, on the authority of some of\nour scholars, on the authority of Ali ibn Uqbah ibn Qays ibn Saman ibn Abu Rabihah, the\nfreed slave of the Messenger of Allah (SA), who hurried the transmission that\nm\nThe Commander of the Faithful was questioned, \"With what do you recognize your\nLord?\" He (AS) answered, \"With what He introduced Himself.\" It was said: \"How did He\nintroduce Himself to you?\" He (AS) replied, No image resembles Him. He is neither\nperceived by the senses, nor compared with the people. He is Near in His Farness, and\nFar in His Nearness. He is Above all Things. It cannot be said that \"something is above\nHim,\" as He is in front of everything. It cannot be said that \"He has a front,\" since He is\nInside Everything, but without being contained. He is Outside of Everything, but without\n312\nbeing absent from anything. Glory be Him! There is nothing like unto Him. He is the\nOriginator of All Things.\n3. My father (RA) related to me that Sad ibn Abd Allah said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn\nMuhammad ibn Isa, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Abu Umayr, on the authority of\nMuhammad ibn Humran, on the authority of al-Fadl ibn al-Sakan, on the authority of Abu Abd\nAllah AS) that\nThe Commander of the Faithful said: \"Recognize Allah through Allah, the Messenger\nthrough the message, and the ones vested with authority [ulu al-amr] through their\nbeneficence, justice, and good deeds.\"\n4. Abu al-Husayn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Ishaq al-Farisi said: Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn\nAbu Said al-Nisawi said: Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah al-Sughdi said in\nMarw that Muhammad ibn Yaqub ibn al-Hakam al-Askari and his brother Muadh ibn Yaqub\nboth said: Muhammad ibn Sinan al-Hanzali said: Abd Allah ibn Asim said: Abd al-Rahman\nibn Qays said, on the authority of Abu Hashim al-Rummani, on the authority of Zadhan that\nSalman the Persian related the following detailed tradition concerning the coming of\nthe Catholicos to Median with one hundred Christians and asking Abu Bakr questions.\nHe could not answer so he guided them to the Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abu\nTalib (AS). Therefore, he asked Ali (AS) some questions; thus, he answered them all.\nAmong the questions the Catholicos asked him was: \"Tell me. Did you recognize Allah\nthrough Muhammad or di you recognize Muhammad through Allah, the Mighty and\nHigh?\" Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) replied, I did not recognize Allah through Muhammad\n(SA), but I recognized Muhammad through Allah, the Mighty and High, when He created\nhim and made in him the size of the length and breadth. Hence I recognized that He was\nthe Planner of the Produced through reasoning, and inspiration, the same way He\ninspired His Angels to recognize and obey Him without any compeer and quality.\nThe Compiler of this book says: The tradition is long. We have extracted from it the required\npassage. I have transmitted all of it in the end of the book Al-Nubuwwah.\n5. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said:\nMuhammad ibn Yaqub said:\n313\nThe meaning of\" \"recognize Allah through Allah\" is that Allah, the Mighty and High, created\npersons, colors, and substances. Therefore, the essences are bodies and the substances are\nspirits. He, the Mighty and High, resembles neither body nor spirit. Nobody has any effect or\ncause in creation of a sensitive, perceiving spirit. He is Matchless in the creation of spirits, and\nbodies. Therefore, whoever negates from Him the two likenesses - the likeness of bodies and\nthe likeness of spirits - recognizes Allah through Allah. And whoever views Him as a body, a\nspirit or a light, has not recognized Allah through Allah.\n6. Ahmad ibn Ziyad ibn Jafar al-Hamdani (RA) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim said, on the\nauthority of is father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Sinan, on the authority of Ziyad ibn alMundhar, on the authority of Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Ali al-Baqir (AS), on the authority of his\nfather, on the authority of his grandfather (AS) that\nVerily, a man stood before the Commander of the Faithful (AS) and asked, \"O\nCommander of the Faithful! With what did you recognize your Lord?\" He replied,\n\"Through abolishment of decision and invalidation of ambition. When I had an\nambition, something obstructed my ambition. And when I mad a decision, the Divine\nDecree opposed my decision. Hence, I came to know that the Planner was other than\nme.\" He asked, \"Then with what did you thank Him?\" He (AS) answered, \"I looked at a\ntribulation, which He took away from me, and with which he afflicted someone else.\nHence, I learned that He had bless me, and so I thanked Him.\" The man, asked, \"Why\ndo you desire to meet Him?\" Imam (AS) replied, \"When I saw him choosing the\nreligion of His angels, Messengers and Prophets (AS), I learned that He had honored\nme with this, and did not forget me. Hence, I desire to meet Him.\"\n314\n7. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Marwazi al-Muqri said: Abu Amr Muhammad\nibn Jafar al-Muqri said: Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Musili said in Baghdad that Muhammad\nibn Asim al-Tarifi said: Ayyash ibn Yazid ibn al-Hasanibn Ali al-Kahhal freed salve of Zayd\nibn Ali said: my father related to me that\nMusa ibn Jafar (AS) related to me that a group of people said to al-Sadiq (AS), \"We\npray but our prayers are not granted.\" He (AS) responded, \"If that is the case, it is\nbecause you pray to One whom you do not truly recognize.\"\n8. Al-Husayn ibn Ahmad ibn Idris (RA) said: my father said: Ibrahim ibn Hashim said, on the\nauthority of Muhammad ibn Abu Umayr, on the authority of Hisham ibn Salim that\nAbu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) was asked, \"How did you recognize your Lord?' He (AS)\nreplied, \"Through abolishment of decision and invalidation of ambition. My decision\nwas abolished, and when I had an ambition it was invalidated.\"\n9. Al-Husayn ibn Ibrahim ibn Ahmad ibn Hisham al-Muaddab (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Abu\nAbd Allah al-Kufi said: Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Barmaki said: Muhammad ibn Abd alRahman al-Khazzaz al-Kufi said: Sulayman ibn Jafar said: Ali ibn al-Hakam said: Hisham ibn\nSalim said\n315\n. \n*\nI was in the presence of Muhammad ibn al-Muman al-Ahwal, when a man stood up\nbefore him, and asked him, \"How did you recognize your Lord?\" He replied, \"By means\nof His Direction, His Instruction, His Introduction, and His Guidance.\"\nHe says: I left his presence, and met with Hisham ibn al-Hakam, so I asked him, \"What\nshould I say to someone who asks me: how did you recognize your Lord?\"\nHisham relied, \"If someone asked me: what did you recognize your Lord with? I would\nsay: I recognized Allah, High be His Glory, though my own body as that is the thing\nwhich is the closest to me. Verily, my body is composed of assembled parts and\nformed of components which were created, the subject of intelligent design, and\nengineering. My body increases after decrease, and is reduced after enlargement. My\nbody has different senses, like sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, as well as\ndifferent limbs. My body was created in weakness, deficiency and contempt. None of\nthe sense can perceive the function of the other, nor do they have strength over others.\nThey are incapable of attracting benefits to themselves and preventing harm to\nthemselves. Wisdom dictates that it is impossible for something to be compiled without\na compiler, and that it is impossible for an image to be made without an artist. Thus, I\nlearned that my body has a Creator, and that my image was made by an Artist, Who is\ncontrary to them from all dimensions. Allah, the Mighty and High, has said: And in your\nown souls (too); will you not then see.\"\n10. Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq (RA) said: Muhammad ibn Jafar Abu\nal-Husayn al-Asadi said: al-Husayn ibn al-Mamun al-Qarashi said, on the authority of Umr\nibn Abd al-Aziz, on the authority of Hisham ibn al-Hakam that\nAbu Shakir al-Daysani said to me: \"Verily, I have a query; I want you to take permission\nfor me from your companion. For I have certainly asked about it from many scholars.\n316\nThey have not been able to answer me with a satisfactory answer.\" So I said: \"Would\nyou like to tell me the query. Perhaps I have an answer that would please you.\"\nHe replied, \"I would certainly like to meet Abu Abd Allah (AS) with this query.\" So I\nobtained the permission for him and he entered his presence and asked him (AS), \"Do\nyou permit me to ask a question?\" The Imam (AS) replied, \"Ask what has come to you.\"\nHe asked, \"How can you prove that you have a Creator?\" Consequently, he (AS)\nresponded, I found myself not free from one of two possibilities: either I have crated\nmyself, or someone else has created me. If I have created myself, then I am not free\nfrom one of the two meanings: either I created myself while I was already existent, or I\ncreated myself while I was on nonexistent. Hence, if I created myself, and I already\nexited, then I was self-sufficient of giving existence to myself. And if I was nonexistent,\nthen you know that the nonexistent cannot bring about a thing. Therefore, the third\nmeaning is proved that I have a Creator and that is Allah, the Lord of the Universe.\nAl-Daysani got up and did not negate the answer.\nThe Compiler of this book says: The correct statement in this chapter is to say: we have\nrecognized Allah through Allah, because if we recognized Him through our intellects then\nHe, the Mighty and High, is the Bestower of our intellects. And if we recognized Him, the\nMighty and High, through His Prophets, Messengers and Proofs (AS) then He, the Mighty\nand High, is the One that delegates them, sends them, and the One who has taken them\nas His Proofs. If we have recognized Him though ourselves then He, the Mighty and\nHigh, is the One who brought us about. Thus, through Him we have recognized Him.\nAl-Sadiq (AS) has said: \"If Allah did not exist then we (Imams) would not have been\nknown, and if we were not there, then Allah would not be recognized.\" The meaning of\nthat is that if the Proofs did not exist, then Allah would not be recognized the way He\ndeserves to be recognized, and if Allah did not exist, then the Proofs would not have\nbeen known.\nI have heard some theologians say: \"Even if a person were born in a desert on earth and even\nif he found nobody to guide him until he becomes big, contemplating the heaves and the\nearth would be sufficient to guide him to the fact that there is One Creator who brought\nthem about.\"\nI would respond: Verily, this is something that has not happened, and it relates the news of\nsomething that has not happened. If it has happened, how could it be? If such a thing ever\ntook place, then that man must have been a Proof of Allah, may His Remembrance of\nHimself be Exalted, or a Prophet (AS). Allah sent different type of Prophets. Some were\nindividual Prophets, who were individually guided. Some were sent to their families, and\nchildren. Some were sent to the people in their region. Some were sent to the people in\ntheir city. And some were sent to all of humanity.\nAs for the reasoning of Ibrahim (AS), the Friend of Allah, when he looked at Venus, the Moon,\nand the Sun, when they set he said: O people! Verily, I am free from the partners you\nascribe to Allah. He (AS) was a Prophet who had inspiration, was delegate and sent by\nAllah. All of his words were through the inspiration of Allah, the Mighty and High. As we see\nin the Word of the Mighty and High: This is Our argument which We gave to Abraham\nrebutting his people.\nPeople are not all like Ibrahim (AS). If it were sufficient to simply think about Allah without the\nguidance and Direction of Allah, the Mighty and High, then why did Allah, the Mighty and High,\nreveal what He revealed of His Word: So know that there is no god but Allah, and His\nWord: Say: He Allah is One, and His Word: Wonderful Originator of heavens and the\nearth! How could He have a son when He has no consort and He is the Knower of\nsubtleties, the Aware. Also the last verse of the chapter \"The Banishment,\" and other verses\nabout Divine Unity.\n317\nChapter Forty -Two: Ithbat Huduth al-Alam. The Assertion of the\nEmergence of the Universe - 7 traditions\n1. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan Ahmad ibn al-Walid (may Allah have mercy o him) said:\nMuhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Saffar said, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, on\nthe authority of al-Husayn ibn Said that Ali ibn Mansur related to me that I heard Hisham ibn\nal-Hakam that\nAbu Shakir al-Daysani entered the presence of Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) and said to\nhim, Verily, you are one of the shining stars, while your forefathers (AS) were brilliant\nfull-moons, and your foremothers were the wisest of women. Your origin is the most\nhonorable origins. When the learned are mentioned then you are at the top of the list.\nInform me, O Ocean (of Knowledge)! How can one prove the emergence of the\nuniverse?\" Abu Abd Allah (AS) answered, \"Through reason and by comparing it to the\nthings which are closest to us.\" He asked, \"What would that be?\" The reporter says:\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) asked for an egg and placed it on his palm and said: \"This is a\ncontainer. Inside its shell are the albumin, and the egg-yolk. With time, colorful peacock\nfeathers will burst out of it. Has anything entered it?\" He replied, \"No.\" The Imam (AS)\nsaid: \"Then this is a proof of the emergence of the universe.\" He responded, \"Your\nanswer is both nice an concise. I now understand that we cannot accept anything\nunless we see it with our eyes, here it with our ears, smell it with our noses, taste it\nwith our tongues, touch it with our hands, or feel it in our hearts with certainty.\" Abu Abd\nAllah (AS) said: \"You have mentioned the five senses. However, they are not useful\nwithout proof, in the same way that darkness cannot be prevented but by light.\"\n318\n2. Ahmad ibn Ziyad ibn Jafar al-Hamdani (RA) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim said, on the\nauthority of his father, on the authority of al-Abbas ibn Amr al-Fuqaymi, on the authority of\nHisham ibn al-Hakam ibn al-Hakam saying that\nIbn Abu al-Awja' entered the presence of al-Sadiq (AS) so al-Sadiq asked him, \"O son\nof Abu al-Awja'! Are you created or not?\" He replied, \"No, I am not created.\" Al-Sadiq\n(AS) said to him, \"So, if you were created, then how would you be?\" The reporter says:\nIbn Au al-Awja' could not provide an answer. Therefore, he stood up and left.\n3. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya la-Attar said: Sad ibn Abd Allah said: Ibrahim in\nHashim said on the authority of Ali ibn Mabad, on the authority of al-Husayn ibn Khalid that\nA man entered the presence (of Imam Abu al-Hasan Ali al-Rida) and said: \"O son of the\nMessenger of Allah (SA)! What is the proof that the universe emerged?\" He (AS)\nreplied, \"You did not exist, and yet you came into being. You already know that you\nhave not created yourself, and that you have not been created by someone like you.\"\n4. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (RA) said: Muhammad ibn al-Hasan alSaffar said on the authority of Ibrahim ibn Hashim, on the authority of Muhammad ibn\nHammad, on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Ibrahim, on the authority of Yunus ibn Abd alRahman, on the authority of Yunus ibn Yaqub that Ali ibn Mansur reported to me that\n319\n320\nHisham ibn al-Hakam reported to me that An atheist in Egypt was informed of some\nknowledge from Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) so he left for Medina to debate with him.\nHowever, he did not find him. It was said to him: \"He is in Mecca.\" So the atheist left\nfor Mecca. While we were with Abu Abd Allah (AS), the atheist came close to us while we\nwere circumambulating [tawaf] the Kabah. The atheist bumped shoulders with Abu\nAbd Allah (AS), so the Imam (AS) asked him \"What is your name?\"\nHe replied, \"My name is Abd al-Malik.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Then what is your agnomen [kunya]?\"\nHe answered, \"Abu Abd Allah.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked,\n\"Who is the Sovereign (al-Malik) whom you serve? Is He the Sovereign of the Heavens,\nor is he one of the sovereigns of the earth? And tell me about your son. Is the servant\n[abd] of the God of Heaven, or a god of the earth?\"\nThe atheist kept quiet.\nSo Abu Abd Allah (AS) continued, \"Say whatever you wish to, you will be defeated.\"\nHisham ibn al-Hakam says: Isaid to the atheist: \"Will you not refute him?\" Thus, he\ndisliked what I said.\nTherefore, Abu Abd Allah (AS) said to him, \"Once I complete the circumambulation,\ncome and see me.\"\nOnce Abu Abd Allah (AS) finished, the atheist came to him and sat down in front of\nhim, while we had gathered before him. Thus, he (AS) addressed the atheist, \"Do you\nknow that the earth has a top and a bottom?\"\nHe replied, \"I do not know, but I certainly think there is nothing below it.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said: \"Thinking [zann] is incapability unless you achieve certainty.\nHave you ascended to the heavens?\"\nHe answered, \"No.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked, Then do you know what is in it?\"\nHe replied, \"I do not.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Then have you been to the east and the west and seen what is\nbehind them?\"\nHe replied, \"No.\"\nThe Imam (AS) responded,\nHow strange! You have not been to the east or the west. You have not descended below\nthe earth. You have not ascended to heaven. You do not have any knowledge of what\nsurrounds them. However, you re in denial of what is in them. Does a wise man deny\nwhat he knows not?\"\nThe atheist said: \"No one but you has eve said such a thing to me.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said: \"You are in doubt as to whether He exist or not.\"\nThe atheist replied, \"That might be it.\"\nAbu Abd Allah said:\nO man! There is no authority for the one who knows over the one who knows not.\nLikewise, there is no authority for the ignorant over the learned. O my Egyptian brother!\nUnderstand this from me! We never doubt in Allah. Do you not see the sun and the\nmoon, and the night and day? They have recourse, but they do not make mistakes.\nThey come and they go. They are both compelled. There is not place for them except\ntheir own place. If they both had the power to leave, and not come back, then why do\nthey come back? If they both are not compelled, then why does the night change into\nthe day, and the day into night? By Allah, O Egyptian brother, they are both compelled\nto continue their routine. Surely, their Compeller is Wiser and Greater than they are!\"\nThe atheist said: \"You are right.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) then said:\n321\nO Egyptian brother! They way you atheists reason is wrong. Time does not bring\nanything into existence. If the passage of time can take then away, then why does it not\nreturn them? And if the passage of time can return them, when why does it not take\nthem away? They are compelled, O Egyptian brother! The sky has been raised, and the\nearth has been set down. Why is it that the sky does not collide with the earth? And\nwhy is it that the earth does not collide with the sky? Why is it that the earth does not\ngo out of its orbit? Who holds them together and who holds together what is between\nthem?\"\nThe atheist said: \"By Allah! Their Lord and their Master holds them together!\"\nThus, the atheist came to believe through his contact with Abu Abd Allah (AS). Humran\nibn Ayun said to him (AS). \"May I be your ransom! Atheist become believers through\nyou, just like the unbelievers use to become believer through your father (AS).\"\nThe believer, who had believed thanks to Abu Abd Allah (AS), said: \"Make me of your\nstudents.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said to Hisham ibn al-Hakam, \"Take him with you and teach\nhim.\"\nThus, Hisham taught him, and then he became the teacher of the Egyptians, and the\npeople of the northern region (Syria, Jordan, Palestine and Lebanon). He was trained\nspiritually and academically until Abu Abd Allah (AS) was pleased with it.\n5. My father and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid (may Allah have mercy on\nthem) both said: Ahmad ibn Idris and Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Attar both said, on the\nauthority of Muhammad ibn Ahmad, on the authority of Sahl ibn Ziyad, on the authority of\nMuhammad ibn al-Husayn, on the authority of Ali ibn Yaqub al-Hashimi, on the authority of\nMarwan ibn Muslim that\nIbn Abu al-Awja' entered the presence of Abu Abd Allah al-Sadiq (AS) and said: \"Do\nyou not claim that Allah is the Creator of Everything?\" Abu Abd Allah (AS) replied,\n\"Most certainly.\" He said: \"I also create.\" The Imam (AS) asked him, \"How do you\ncreate?\" He responded, \"I relieve my bowels in a place, then I stay away from it, and it\nmakes insects. Therefore, this is my creation.\" Abu Abd Allah (AS) replied, \"Is not the\ncreator o",

The Messenger of Allah (SA) entered when she was with them.\nSo he (SA) said to her, \"When you visit us our houses are filled with perfume.\"\nHence, she replied, \"Your house is the most pleasant due to your own scent, O\nMessenger of Allah.\"\nHe (SA) said: \"When you sell, then be good. However, do not engage in deceptive\nmarketing for that is not a good practice for ensuring wealth.\"\nShe responded, \"I did no come with something to sell. Verily, I came to ask you about\nht Greatness of Allah.\"\nThus, he (SA) said: \"Glory be to Allah! Let me share His Greatness with you.\"\nThe reporter says: then he (SA) continued,\nVerily, the planet earth and everything it contains is like a ring in the vastness of the desert to the one which is below it. The earth and the one below it, and everything they\ncontain, are like a ring in the vastness of the desert to the one that is below them. This\nhow they are until it reaches the seventh one.\nThen he recited this verse: Allah is He who created seven heavens, and the Earth the\nlike of them.\nThe seven heavens and whatever they contain are on the back of a rooster like a ring in\nthe open desert. The rooster has two wings; one in the East and the other in the West, and\nits feet are on the borderline.

Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Qittan said: Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Zakariyya said: Bakr ibn Abd\nAllah ibn Hubayb said, on the authority of Tamim ibn Buhlul, on the authority of Nasr ibn\nMuzahim al-Minqari, on the authority of Amr ibn Sad, on the authority of Abu Mikhnaf Lut ibn\nYahya, on the authority of Abu Mansur, on the authority of Zayd ibn Wahab that\n  2  \n300\nThe Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abu Talib was asked about the Omnipotence of\nAllah, Exalted and Glorified be He. Therefore, he (AS) stood up, delivered a sermon\npraising and exalting Allah. He then said:\nVerily, Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has created angels that are so enormous that\nthey cannot fly down to the earth due to the sheer size of their numerous wings. Among\nthem is an angel that is so huge that even if jinn and humankind worked together to\ndescribe him, they would be unable to do so due to the distance between its joints and\nthe beauty of its composed image.\nHow can one be described which has seven hundred years of distance between its\nshoulders and its earlobes? Among them is one who obstructs the horizon with one of\nits many wings without the complete enormity of its body. Among them is one who is\nso tall that the heavens merely reach his waist. And among them is one whose feet\nfloat in the atmosphere and its knees reach the earth. There is also an angel who is so\nhuge that all of the water on earth would fit in the cavity of his thumb. There is also one\nwho is so hug that if ships were cast into the tears of its eyes, they could sail for the rest\nof eternity. Blessed is Allah, the Best of the Creators.\nHe (AS) was questioned about the veils, so he answered,\nThe first of the veils are seven in number. The thickness of each veil is five hundred\nyears of travel. And the distance between the two veils is the distance traveled in five\nhundred years. The third veil is composed of seventy veils. Between each veil is the\ndistance traveled in five hundred years. The length of each veil is five hundred years of\ntravel.\nThere are seventy thousand angels acting as the gatekeepers for every veil. The\nstrength of each one of these angels is equal to the strength of all the jinn and men.\nThey are the source of darkness, light, fire, smoke, clouds, lightning, rain, thunder,\nglow, sand, mountain, dust, water and all rivers. There are different veils. The\nthickness of each one of these veils is the distance traveled over the course of seventy\nthousand years.\nThen there are the Canopies of Glory [jalal], and there are seventy such canopies. In\neach canopy there are seventy angels. Between each canopy is the distance traveled\nduring five hundred years.\nThen there is the Canopy of Mighty [izz]; then the Canopy of Pride [kibriya]; then the\ncanopy of Greatness [azamah]; then the Canopy of Sacredness [qudus]; then the\nCanopy of Power [jabarut]; and then the Canopy of Pride [fakhr]. Then is the white\nlight, then the Canopy of Oneness [wahdaniyah], which spans the distance traveled\nover seventy thousand years into seventy thousand years; and then there is the Most\nSublime Veil.\nHence, his (AS) speech ended and he became silent.\nTherefore, Umar said to him (AS), \"I do not want to remain for a day when I do not see\nyou, O Father of al-Hasan.\"",

It is an angel among the angels\nof Allah, the Mighty and High. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has placed its feet at the\nlowest level of the seventh earth. It crosses the earths, to the end of the earths, until it\ncomes out at the horizon of heaven. Then it passes the horizon until its first visible part\nreaches the Empyrean, while it says: \"Glory be to You, my Lord.\"\nVerily, this rooster has two wings. If it would spread them out, they would cross both\nthe East and the West. When it is the end of the night, it spreads its two wings, shakes\nthem, and it calls out with the glorification that \"Glory be to Allah, the Sovereign, the\nMost Holy. Glory be to the Great, the Supreme Being [al-mutal], the Most Holy. There is\nno god but He, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsistent.\"\nWhen it says so then all the roosters of the earth glorify, spread their wings, and begin\nto crow. And when that rooster becomes still then the rooster on the earth become still.\nAt the time of dawn, it spreads its two wings, which cross the East and the West, and\nshakes them, and calls out with the glorification: \"Glory be to Allah, the Great. Glory\nbe to Allah, the Honorable, the Subduer. Glory be to Allah, the Possessor of the Glorious\nEmpyrean. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the Lofty Empyrean.\"\nWhen it does that then all the roosters of the earth do their glorification. Therefore, it\nwakes the rooster of the earth, who awake and answer its glorification of Allah, the\nMighty and High. The rooster ahs the purest white feathers I have ever seen. Below its\nwhite feathers it has the darkest green fuzz that I have ever seen. I am still longing to\nlook at the feathers of that rooster.",

If I have created myself, then I am not free\nfrom one of the two meanings: either I created myself while I was already existent, or I\ncreated myself while I was on nonexistent. Hence, if I created myself, and I already\nexited, then I was self-sufficient of giving existence to myself. And if I was nonexistent,\nthen you know that the nonexistent cannot bring about a thing. Therefore, the third\nmeaning is proved that I have a Creator and that is Allah, the Lord of the Universe.\nAl-Daysani got up and did not negate the answer.\nThe Compiler of this book says: The correct statement in this chapter is to say: we have\nrecognized Allah through Allah, because if we recognized Him through our intellects then\nHe, the Mighty and High, is the Bestower of our intellects. And if we recognized Him, the\nMighty and High, through His Prophets, Messengers and Proofs (AS) then He, the Mighty\nand High, is the One that delegates them, sends them, and the One who has taken them\nas His Proofs. If we have recognized Him though ourselves then He, the Mighty and\nHigh, is the One who brought us about. Thus, through Him we have recognized Him.\nAl-Sadiq (AS) has said: \"If Allah did not exist then we (Imams) would not have been\nknown, and if we were not there, then Allah would not be recognized.\" The meaning of\nthat is that if the Proofs did not exist, then Allah would not be recognized the way He\ndeserves to be recognized, and if Allah did not exist, then the Proofs would not have\nbeen known.\nI have heard some theologians say: \"Even if a person were born in a desert on earth and even\nif he found nobody to guide him until he becomes big, contemplating the heaves and the\nearth would be sufficient to guide him to the fact that there is One Creator who brought\nthem about.\"\nI would respond: Verily, this is something that has not happened, and it relates the news of\nsomething that has not happened. If it has happened, how could it be? If such a thing ever\ntook place, then that man must have been a Proof of Allah, may His Remembrance of\nHimself be Exalted, or a Prophet (AS). Allah sent different type of Prophets. Some were\nindividual Prophets, who were individually guided. Some were sent to their families, and\nchildren. Some were sent to the people in their region. Some were sent to the people in\ntheir city. And some were sent to all of humanity.\nAs for the reasoning of Ibrahim (AS), the Friend of Allah, when he looked at Venus, the Moon,\nand the Sun, when they set he said: O people! Verily, I am free from the partners you\nascribe to Allah. He (AS) was a Prophet who had inspiration, was delegate and sent by\nAllah. All of his words were through the inspiration of Allah, the Mighty and High. As we see\nin the Word of the Mighty and High: This is Our argument which We gave to Abraham\nrebutting his people.\nPeople are not all like Ibrahim (AS). If it were sufficient to simply think about Allah without the\nguidance and Direction of Allah, the Mighty and High, then why did Allah, the Mighty and High,\nreveal what He revealed of His Word: So know that there is no god but Allah, and His\nWord: Say: He Allah is One, and His Word: Wonderful Originator of heavens and the\nearth! How could He have a son when He has no consort and He is the Knower of\nsubtleties, the Aware. Also the last verse of the chapter \"The Banishment,\" and other verses\nabout Divine Unity.",

It was said to him: \"He is in Mecca.\" So the atheist left\nfor Mecca. While we were with Abu Abd Allah (AS), the atheist came close to us while we\nwere circumambulating [tawaf] the Kabah. The atheist bumped shoulders with Abu\nAbd Allah (AS), so the Imam (AS) asked him \"What is your name?\"\nHe replied, \"My name is Abd al-Malik.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Then what is your agnomen [kunya]?\"\nHe answered, \"Abu Abd Allah.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked,\n\"Who is the Sovereign (al-Malik) whom you serve? Is He the Sovereign of the Heavens,\nor is he one of the sovereigns of the earth? And tell me about your son. Is the servant\n[abd] of the God of Heaven, or a god of the earth?\"\nThe atheist kept quiet.\nSo Abu Abd Allah (AS) continued, \"Say whatever you wish to, you will be defeated.\"\nHisham ibn al-Hakam says: Isaid to the atheist: \"Will you not refute him?\" Thus, he\ndisliked what I said.\nTherefore, Abu Abd Allah (AS) said to him, \"Once I complete the circumambulation,\ncome and see me.\"\nOnce Abu Abd Allah (AS) finished, the atheist came to him and sat down in front of\nhim, while we had gathered before him. Thus, he (AS) addressed the atheist, \"Do you\nknow that the earth has a top and a bottom?\"\nHe replied, \"I do not know, but I certainly think there is nothing below it.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said: \"Thinking [zann] is incapability unless you achieve certainty.\nHave you ascended to the heavens?\"\nHe answered, \"No.\"\nThe Imam (AS) asked, Then do you know what is in it?\"\nHe replied, \"I do not.\"\nThe Imam (AS) said: \"Then have you been to the east and the west and seen what is\nbehind them?\"\nHe replied, \"No.\"\nThe Imam (AS) responded,\nHow strange! You have not been to the east or the west. You have not descended below\nthe earth. You have not ascended to heaven. You do not have any knowledge of what\nsurrounds them. However, you re in denial of what is in them. Does a wise man deny\nwhat he knows not?\"\nThe atheist said: \"No one but you has eve said such a thing to me.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said: \"You are in doubt as to whether He exist or not.\"\nThe atheist replied, \"That might be it.\"\nAbu Abd Allah said:\nO man! There is no authority for the one who knows over the one who knows not.\nLikewise, there is no authority for the ignorant over the learned. O my Egyptian brother!\nUnderstand this from me! We never doubt in Allah. Do you not see the sun and the\nmoon, and the night and day? They have recourse, but they do not make mistakes.\nThey come and they go. They are both compelled. There is not place for them except\ntheir own place. If they both had the power to leave, and not come back, then why do\nthey come back? If they both are not compelled, then why does the night change into\nthe day, and the day into night? By Allah, O Egyptian brother, they are both compelled\nto continue their routine. Surely, their Compeller is Wiser and Greater than they are!\"\nThe atheist said: \"You are right.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) then said:\nO Egyptian brother! They way you atheists reason is wrong. Time does not bring\nanything into existence. If the passage of time can take then away, then why does it not\nreturn them? And if the passage of time can return them, when why does it not take\nthem away? They are compelled, O Egyptian brother! The sky has been raised, and the\nearth has been set down. Why is it that the sky does not collide with the earth? And\nwhy is it that the earth does not collide with the sky? Why is it that the earth does not\ngo out of its orbit? Who holds them together and who holds together what is between\nthem?\"\nThe atheist said: \"By Allah! Their Lord and their Master holds them together!\"\nThus, the atheist came to believe through his contact with Abu Abd Allah (AS). Humran\nibn Ayun said to him (AS). \"May I be your ransom! Atheist become believers through\nyou, just like the unbelievers use to become believer through your father (AS).\"\nThe believer, who had believed thanks to Abu Abd Allah (AS), said: \"Make me of your\nstudents.\"\nAbu Abd Allah (AS) said to Hisham ibn al-Hakam, \"Take him with you and teach\nhim.\"\nThus, Hisham taught him, and then he became the teacher of the Egyptians, and the\npeople of the northern region (Syria, Jordan, Palestine and Lebanon).

    "Content": "Ahmad ibn Ziyad ibn Jafar al-Hamdani (RA) said: Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashim said, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Abu Umayr that Musa ibn Jafar (AS) said: Allah will not make the Hell eternal for anyone except for those who disbelieved and denied, and those who went astray and rejected monotheism. Believers who refrained from major sins will not be asked about the minor sins they may have committed. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says: If you shun the great sins which you are forbidden, We will do away with your small sins and cause you to enter an honorable place of entering. The reporter says: I asked him, \"O son of the messenger of Allah (SA)! To which sinners does intercession [shafaat] apply?\" He (AS) replied, \"My father (AS) related to me, on the authority of his forefathers (AS) the authority of Ali (AS) that: The Messenger of Allah (SA) said: \"Verily, my intercession applies to the members of my Ummah who committed major sins. As for the good-doers, they should not be concerned.\" Ibn Abu Umayr says: I asked him, O son of the Messenger of Allah! How can intercession apply to those who commit major sins, when Allah, exalted be His Remembrance, says: And they do not intercede except for him whom He approves and for fear of Him they tremble; and whoever commits major sins cannot be the approved one, Thus, he (AS) responded, O Abu Ahmad! There is not a believer who commits a sin but that it grieves him, and he regrets it. The Prophet (SA) has said: \"Regret is sufficient for repentance.\" He (AS) has also said: Whoever is pleased by his good deeds and grieved by his bad deeds is a believer.\" Therefore, he who commits a sin, and does not regret it, is not a believer, and intercession will not apply to him because he is unjust. Allah, exalted be His Remembrance, says: The unjust shall not have nay compassionate friend nor any intercessor who should be obeyed. I asked him, \"O son of the Messenger of Allah! Why is a person an unbeliever is he does not feel any remorse for his sins?\" He (AS) replied, O Abu Ahmad! If someone knows that he has committed a major sin, and knows that he will be punished for it, he will surely regret his action. If feels remorse, he has repented, and deserves intercession. If he does not regret his action, he will persist in his sin. Persistent, habitual sinners are not forgiven, because they do not believe that they will be punished for their actions. If they believed in the punishment then surely they would regret their action. The Prophet (SA) said: No major sin remains after repentance. And no sin remains minor if one engages in it habitually. As for the Word of Allah, the Mighty and High: And they do not intercede except for him whom He approves; then he will not receive intercession unless Allah approves his belief. Belief is the confirmation of reward for good deeds and punishment over bad deeds. If Allah accepts a person's faith as sincere, it is because the person regrets the sins he has committed, and fears their punishment on the Day of Judgment.",

He then sent the Messenger (SA) to them, and revealed to him the Book (the Qur'an) in which He commanded and He forbade. In it, He commanded the ritual prayer and ritual fasting. Thus, the Messenger of Allah (SA) was made to sleep in and miss the prayer. Hence, Allah said: I made you sleep, and I wake you up. Now go and pray. They way, they will learn what they should do when this happens to them. It is not as they say: When one sleeps in and misses a prayer, he is lost.' The same applies to fasting. Allah says: I make you ill and I cure you. Once I cure you, make up for the fasting you have missed.' Abu Abd Allah (AS) then added, I view all matters, this way. You will not find any of my followers oppressed by religion. Nor will you find anyone over whom Allah has not provided evidence through His Divine Will. I do not say: They can do whatever they wish.' Then he (AS) continued, Verily, it is Allah who guides and misleads. He only commands people to do what they are capable of doing. Whatever the people are commanded to do, they have the ability to do it. Whatever the people are unable to do, they have not been commanded to do it. Still, most people are devoid of good. Then he (AS) read this verse: It shall be no crime in the weak, nor in the sick, not in those who do not find what they should spend (to stay being), so long as they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger; there is no way (to blame) against the doers of good; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful; nor in those who when they came to you that you might carry them. [And said:] Thus, they are unburdened from these, because they cannot find them. The Compiler of this book says: His (AS) word: \"Verily, it is Allah that guides and misleads.\" The meaning of this is that He, the Mighty and High, guides the believers to Paradise on the Day of Judgment, and misleads the unjust away from Paradise. Verily, the Mighty and High, has said: Surely (as for) those who believe and do good, their Lord will guide them by their faith; there shall flow from beneath them rivers in gardens of bliss.

He then sent the Messenger (SA) to them, and revealed to him the Book (the Qur'an) in which He commanded and He forbade. In it, He commanded the ritual prayer and ritual fasting. Thus, the Messenger of Allah (SA) was made to sleep in and miss the prayer. Hence, Allah said: I made you sleep, and I wake you up. Now go and pray. They way, they will learn what they should do when this happens to them. It is not as they say: When one sleeps in and misses a prayer, he is lost.' The same applies to fasting. Allah says: I make you ill and I cure you. Once I cure you, make up for the fasting you have missed.' Abu Abd Allah (AS) then added, I view all matters, this way. You will not find any of my followers oppressed by religion. Nor will you find anyone over whom Allah has not provided evidence through His Divine Will. I do not say: They can do whatever they wish.' Then he (AS) continued, Verily, it is Allah who guides and misleads. He only commands people to do what they are capable of doing. Whatever the people are commanded to do, they have the ability to do it. Whatever the people are unable to do, they have not been commanded to do it. Still, most people are devoid of good. Then he (AS) read this verse: It shall be no crime in the weak, nor in the sick, not in those who do not find what they should spend (to stay being), so long as they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger; there is no way (to blame) against the doers of good; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful; nor in those who when they came to you that you might carry them. [And said:] Thus, they are unburdened from these, because they cannot find them. The Compiler of this book says: His (AS) word: \"Verily, it is Allah that guides and misleads.\" The meaning of this is that He, the Mighty and High, guides the believers to Paradise on the Day of Judgment, and misleads the unjust away from Paradise. Verily, the Mighty and High, has said: Surely (as for) those who believe and do good, their Lord will guide them by their faith; there shall flow from beneath them rivers in gardens of bliss.

What is your cousin's intention in setting up a meeting between me and the pagans and rhetoricians?\" The Nawfali says I answered, \"May I be yoiur ransom! He intends to test you, and wants to know how much knowledge you possess. Verily, he has based his assumption on shaky grounds. By Allah, what he has set up is evil.\" The Imam (AS) asked, \"And what has he set up?\" Al-nawfali said: The heretics and the theologians are different from the learned. That is because a learned does not deny the undeniable, whereas rhetoricians, theologians, and polytheists are people who deny things and try to prove what is not true. If you argue with them and tell them that God is One, they would say, Confirm His Oneness.' And if you say that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, they would say, Prove his Prophethood.' May I be your ransom! They confuse you and make you disprove your own proofs. They continue to falsify until you back off. Beware of them! May I be your ransom!\" Al-Nawfali added, \"The Imam (AS) then smiled, and told me, O Nawfali! Do you fear that they will defeat my arguments?\" Al-Nawfali said: No, by Allah! I have no worries about you. Allah willing, I hope that Allah will make you victorious over them!' The Imam (AS) asked again, O Nawfali! Would you like to know when Al-Mamun will regret his actions?\" He answered, Yes.' The Imam (AS) said: When he hears me argue with the people of the Torah quoting their own Torah, with the people of the Gospel quoting their own Gospel with the people of the Psalms quoting their own Psalms, with the Sabians in their own Hebrew language, with the Zoroastrian priests in their own Persian, with the Romans in their own Latin, and with the rhetoricians using their very own languages. So, if I close the avenues of argument in the face of each arguing party and disprove his claim, making him renounce his statement from its onset and referring to my own statement, then al-Mamun will realize that he has not achieved what he aspires to achieve. It is then that he will feel regret. And there is no power and no strength save in Allah, the Most High, the Most Great.

Therefore, I have the glad tidings of him to the disciples and they believed in him.' The Catholicos said: \"John did quote this from the Messiah.

If you deny them, then it is incumbent to kill you for blasphemy against your Lord, your Prophet, and your Book. The Catholicos said: \"I do not deny the clear things in the Bible. On the contrary, I profess them.\" The Imam (AS) asked others who were present, \"Bear witness to his profession.\" Then the Imam (AS) said to the Catholicos, \"O Catholicos! Ask me any other question that you wish to ask.\" The Catholicos asked, \"What about the disciples of Jesus, the son of Mary? How many were they? And tell me about the scholars of the Bible. How many were then?\" Al-Rida (AS) said: You have found the expert! As for (the number of) the disciples, they were twelve men. The best and the most learned of them was Aluqas (Luke). As for the (number of) Christian scholars, there were three men: John (Yohanna), the great' at Aj, John at Qirqisiya, and john al-Daylami at Zijan, who made reference to Prophet Muhammad, his Household and his nation. It is he who gave glad tidings to the nation of Jesus and the Children of Israel about him. The Imam (AS) added, \"O Christian! By Allah, we believe in Jesus, who believed in Muhammad. We have nothing against Jesus except for his weakness and the paucity of his fasting and prayer. The Catholicos replied, \"By Allah, you have corrupted your knowledge! You affair has become weak! I though that you were the most learned of the Muslims!\" Al-Rida (AS) asked, \"Why?\" The Catholicos said: \"You said that Jesus was weak in fasting and prayer when, in fact, he never broke fasting during the day, and never slept during the night. He always fasted during the day, and he always prayed throughout the night.\" Al-Rida (AS) said: \"For whom did he fast and pray?\" The Catholicos did no answer, not knowing what to say. Al-Rida (AS) said: \"I want to ask you a question.\" The Catholicos said: \"Ask. I will respond if I have the answer.\" Al-Rida (AS) asked, \"Why do you deny that Jesus gave life to the dead with the permission of Allah, the Mighty and High?\" The Catholicos said: \"I deny that because whoever is able to give life to the dead, and to heal the blind and the leprous is a Lord worthy of service.\" Al-Rida (AS) said: Very well. However, Elijah [al-Yasa'] performed the same miracles as Jesus did. He walked on water, gave life to the dead, and healed the blind and the leprous Why did his nation not adopt him as a Lord? Why did no anyone worship him as a god other than Allah? The Prophet Ezekiel [Hizqil] did just what Jesus did. He gave life to thirty-five men sixty years after their death. Then the Imam (AS) turned towards the Head of the Rabbis and asked him, O Head of the Rabbis! Do you find the following about some of the youth of the Children of Israel in the Torah? When Nebuchadnezzar [Bakht Nasr] invaded Jerusalem, he enslaved the Children of Israel and brought them to Babylonia. Then Allah, the Mighty and High, sent al-Yasa from them, and he gave life to them. This is in the Torah. No one but an unbeliever of you would deny it. The Head of the Rabbis said: \"I have heard about this and know it.\" The Imam (AS) said: \"You have spoken the truth.\" Then the Imam (AS) said: \"O Jewish man! See if I read from the following Book of the Torah properly.\" The Imam (AS) then recited some of the verses from the Torah for us. The Jewish man, who was surprised at hearing how the Imam (AS) was reciting the Torah, kept moving his body. He then faced the Christian and asked, \"O Christian! Were these words revealed before Jesus or were they revealed after him?\" The Catholicos answe3red, \"They were revealed before him.\" Al-Rida (AS) said: The people of Quraysh gathered around the Messenger of Allah (SA) and asked him to give life to their dead. He sent along Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS) with them and told him, \"go to the cemetery, and loudly call the people about whom they have asked, say, \"O soand-so, so-and-so, etc.\" Tell them, \"Allah's Messenger Muhammad says, Rise with the permission of Allah, the Mighty and High' Then they all rose and brushed off the dust from their heads.\" The people from the tribe of Quraysh walked towards them and asked them about their affairs. They told them that Muhammad (SA) has been raised as a Prophet. The people who had risen from the dead said: \"We wish we had lived in his age and believed in him!\" He healed the blind, the leprous, and the insane. He spoke with the beasts, the birds, the jinn, and demons. Still, we do not adopt him as a Lord other than Allah, the Mighty and High. We do not deny the miracles of the prophets. Since you have adopted Jesus as a Lord, why do you not adopt al-Yasa and Hizqil as lords, for they performed the same miracles as did Jesus, the son of Mary, such as giving life to the dead? Moreover, thousands of the Children of Israel left their homeland in fear of death due to the plague. Allah made them die immediately. The people of the village build a fence around them, and left them there until their bones decayed. One of the prophets of the Children of Israel passed by, and he was amazed when he saw so may decayed bones. Allah, the Mighty and high, revealed to him, \"Would you like Me to bring them to life so that you can admonish them?\" The Prophet said: \"Yes, O Lord!\" Then Allah, the Mighty and High, revealed to him, \"Then call them.\" He said: \"O decayed bones! Rise with Allah's permission.\" They all rose while brushing off the dust from their heads.\" Likewise when Abraham (AS), the friend of the Most Compassionate, took the birds, cut them into pieces, and put each piece on a mountain top. He called out to them and they came towards him. Also Moses (AS) the son of Imran, his companions, and seventy of the men whom he had chosen went to the mountain. They told Moses, \"You have seen Allah. So show Him to us like you have seen Him.\" Moses told them, \"I have not seen Him.\" But they said: \"We shall never believe in you until we see Allah manifestly.\" A thunderbolt struck them, and burned them all up. Only Moses survived. Moses said: O my Lord! I chose seventy men from among the Children of Israel and brought them to the mountain. Shall I return by myself? How shall my people believe what I must tell them? If You desired You could have destroyed al of us long before. Would you destroy us all for the deeds of the foolish ones among us?' Then Allah, the Mighty and High, gave life to them after their death. You cannot deny all these things which I have told you, for the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms and the Qur'an have mentioned them. If all those who gave life to the dead, healed the blind, the leprous and the mad, were adopted as lords other than Allah, then you should also adopt them as Lords. O Christians! What is your opinion? The Catholicos said: \"Yes. You are right. There is no god but Allah.\"",

    "Content": "Then the Imam (AS) turned towards the Head of the Rabbis and told him. O Jewish man! Turn to me. Swear to me by the Ten Commandments which were sent down to Moses, the son of Imran, that the following statement about the Prophet Muhammad (SA) and his nation is not found in the Torah: When the people of the last nation, who are followers of the Rider of the Camel, who glorifies the Lord enormously, new glorification in new churches (implying mosques), then let the Children of Israel flee towards them and their dominion so that their hearts may be tranquil, since there will be swords in their hands with which they will take revenge on the unbelievers around the globe. Is this not written in the Torah? The Head of the Rabbis said; \"Yes, we have found that written in this manner.\" Then the Imam (AS) asked the Catholicos, \"O Christian! How is your knowledge of the Book of Shaya? He answered, \"I know it letter by letter.\" Then the Imam asked them both, \"Do you know that the following statement is made by him, O people! I have seen the picture of the Donkey. He was wearing gowns of light. And I have seen the Rider of the Camel, who is as bright as the moon.'\" They answered, \"Verily, Sha1ya did say that!\" Al-Rida (AS) said: O Christian! Do you know that Jesus said: I am going to my Lord and your Lord, and the Paraclete [farqilita] is coming who shall testify to my truth just as I testified for him, and he shall explain everything to you, and he shall be the one to expose all the sins of nations, and he shall be the one to smash down the pillars of unbelief?' The Catholicos said: \"We accept whatever you cite from the Bible.\" The Imam said: \"O Catholicos! Have you found this in the Bible?\" The Catholicos said: \"Yes.\" Al-Rida (AS) said: \"O Catholicos, when you lost the first Bible, with whom did you find it?\" The Catholicos said: \"We only lost the Bible for one day. Then we found it fresh (in its original state). John and Matthew brought it back to us.\" Al-Rida (AS) asked him, How little you know of the Bible and its scholars! If what you say is correct, then why do you have so many disputes between yourselves regarding the Bible? The source of controversy lies in the Bible which you have in your hands today. Had it been the same as the fist Bible, there would be no dispute over it, However, I will prove this for you myself. Know that when the first Bible was lost, the Christians gathered around their scholars and said to them, Jesus the son of Mary has been killed, and we have lost the Bible. You are the scholars. What do you have?' Luke, Mark and John told them, We have memorized the Bible. Do not worry about it. Do not forsake the churches. We will recite each Gospel of the Bible for you on each Sunday until we put it all together.' Then Luke, Mark, John and Matthew gathered together and put together this Bible after you had lost the first one. These four students were of the first students. Did you know that?\" The Catholicos said: \"I did not know this before. Now I have learned it from you due to your noble knowledge of the Bible. I heard things from you which I knew deep down, and which my heart acknowledges to be the truth. As a result, I have grown in understanding.\" Al-Rida (AS) said: \"Do you accept the evidence I have presented?\" The Catholicos said: \"I completely accept the evidence as correct, and bear witness that it is true.\" Al-Rida (AS) then told al-Ma'mun, his family, and the others who were present, \"Be witnesses to this.\" They said: \"We bear witness.\" Then the Imam (AS) told the Catholicos, I swear by the Son and his Mother to tell us whether you know that Matthew said the following, The Messiah is the son of David, the son of Abraham, the son of Issac, the son of Jacob, the son of Yehuda, the son of Khadrun.' Mark said the following regarding the lineage of Jesus, the son of Mary, He is Allah's Word placed in the human body. So it turned into the human form.' Moreover, Luke said: Jesus the son of Mary and his mother wee humans made of flesh and blood. Then the Holy Sprit entered into them.' Testify as well that Jesus said the following about himself, O disciples! I will tell you the truth. No one will ascend to Heaven, except for him who descends there from, except for the Rider of the Camel, the Seal of the Prophets, for he will ascend to the Heavens, and then will descend therefrom. What do you have to say about that? The Catholicos said; \"These are the words of Jesus. We do not deny them.\" Al-Rida (AS) said: \"If so, what do you say about the testimonies of Luke, Mark and Matthew regarding Jesus and the lineage they attributed to him?\" The Catholicos said: \"They ascribed likes to Jesus.\" Al-Rida (A) said: \"O people! Did he not just bear witness that they (Luke, Mark and Matthew) are the Scholars of the Bible, and what they said was the truth?\" The Catholicos said: \"O Scholar of the Muslims! I would like you to excuse me from discussing about these men.\" Al-Rida (AS) said: \"Fine, I will excuse you from that, O Christian! Ask me whatever you wish to ask.\" The Catholicos said: \"Let someone else ask you questions. By Jesus, I did not think that there was a scholar like you among the Muslims.\"",

    "Content": "Al-Rida (AS) turned towards the Head of the Rabbis and said: \"Will you ask me questions or should I ask?\" The Head of the Rabbis said: \"I will ask. However, I will not accept any proofs from you except those form the Torah, the Bible, the Psalms of David, or the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.\" Al-Rida (AS) said: \"Do not accept any of my proofs unless they are from the Torah as expressed by Moses, the son of Imran, the Bible as expressed by Jesus, the son of Mary, or the Psalms of David as expressed by David.\" The Head of the Rabbis said: \"How can you prove the Prophethood of Muhammad Al-Rida (AS) said: \"Moses, the son of Imran, Jesus, the son of Mary and David, the Vicegerent of Allah on the Earth, have testified to his Prophethood.\" The Head of the Rabbis said: \"Provide evidence of the testimony of Moses, the son of Imran.\" Al-Rida (AS) told him, O Jewish man! Do you know that Moses said the following to the Children of Israel, A prophet will come to you fro among your brethren. Believe in him, and obey him.' Do you know that the Children of Israel have no brethren other than the Children of Ishamel? Do you know about the ties of kinship between Israel and Ishmael and the relationship that existed between them from the past through Abraham? The Head of the Rabbis said: \"These are the words of Moses. I do not deny them.\" Al-Rida (AS) asked him, \"Has any Prophet other than Muhammad (SA) come from among the brethren of the Children of Israel?\" He replied, \"No.\" Al-Rida (AS) said: \"Is this not correct in your opinion?\" The Head of the Rabbis said: \"Yes, but I want you to prove its correctness from the Torah.\" Al-Rida (AS) asked him, \"Do you deny that the Toray says the following to you? There came light from Mount Sinai. Light shined upon us from Mount Sair and it became apparent to us from Mount Faran.'\" The Head of the Rabbis said: \"I am familiar with these words, but I do not know what they mean.\" Al-Rida (AS) said: I will inform you about them. What is meant when it says There came light from Mount Sinai is a reference to the revelations of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, to Moses on mount Sinai. And what is meant when it says, Light shined upon us from Mount Sair' is a reference to the mountain upon which Allah, the Mighty and High, sent revelations of Jesus, the son of Mary. Jesus was on that mountain. And what is meant when it says, and it became apparent to us from Mount Faran.' Faran is a mountain that is one day away from Mecca. As you and your friends said: the Prophet Shaya has said in the Torah that I have seen the picture of the Rider of the Donkey. He was wearing gowns of light. And I have seen the Rider of the Camel, who is as bright as the moon.' Who is the Rider of the Donkey? Who is the Rider of the Camel? The Head of the Rabbis said: \"I do not know who they are.\" The Imam (AS) said: \"The Rider of the Donkey is Jesus, and the Rider of the Camel is Muhammad (SA). Do you deny that this is from the Torah?\" The Head of the Rabbis said: \"No, I do not deny that.\" Then al-Rida (AS) said: \"Do you know the Prophet Hayqua?\" The Head of the Rabbis said: \"Yes, I know him.\" The Imam (AS) said: He said the following which your Book has also stated, Allah brought down the Bayan from Mount Faran. The heavens are filled with the praise of Ahmad and his nation. He will lead his troops at sea just as he carries them on land. He will bring us a new Book after the destruction of the Holy House (in Jerusalem).' Did you know the, and do you believe in it? The Head of the Rabbis said: \"In fact, the Prophet Hayquq has said this. I will not deny his words. Al-Rida (AS) said: David said in his Psalms which you have also read, O my Allah! Appoint him who will establish the practice after the cessation (of the prophets). Did you know of any prophet other than Muhammad (SA) who has established the practice after the end of the period of prophecy? The Head of the Rabbis said: \"this is what David said. We do not deny it. However, he was referring to Jesus, as it was with him that the age of prophecy came to a close.\" Al-Rida (AS) told him, You are wrong. In fact, Jesus endorsed the practices [sunah] of the Torah until Allah raised him up to Himself. It is written in the Bible. The son of the pious woman will go, and the Paraclete will come after him. It is he who will preserve the bonds, explain everything to you, and testify to my truth just as I testified for him. I have brought you the examples, and he will bring you the interpretations. Do you believe that this statement is in the Bible? The Head of the Rabbis said: \"Yes.\" Al-Rida (AS) replied to him, \"O the Head of the Rabbis! I want to ask you about your Prophet Moses.\" The Jewish man said: \"He brought miracles which the prophets before him had not brought.\" The Imam (AS) asked, \"Could you give me an example?\" The Head of the Rabbis replied, \"He split the sea, turned the cane into a slithering serpent, made springs gush from stones, showed his hand white and shining to the onlookers, and other signs the like of which other creatures were unable to bring.\" Al-Rida (AS) replied to him, \"You are right. They are proofs of his Prophethood. He brought the like of which other creatures were unable to brig. Is it obligatory on you to believe in whoever claims Prophethood, and performs something which all other creatures are unable to perform?\" The head of the Rabbis said: \"No, since there is no one like Moses considering his position near his Lord and his closeness to Him. It is not incumbent upon us to profess the Prophethood of whoever claims it, unless he brings us miracles similar to those brought by Moses. The Imam (AS) said: Then how come you admit the Prophethood of the other prophets who preceded Moses who did not split the sea; nor did they make twelve springs gush forth from the stones, nor did they show a white shining hand as Moses did, nor did they turn the came into a slithering serpent. The Jewish man replied: I told you that if they performed miracles as evidence for their Prophethood which all other creatures were unable to perform, and if they brought something the like of which Moses had brought, or they followed what Moses had brought, then it is incumbent upon us to believe in them. Al-Rida (AS) replied to him, \"O Head of the Rabbis! What has prevented you from professing (the Prophethood of) Jesus, the son of Mary? Jesus brought the dead to life, healed the blind and the leprous, made birds formed of clay and breathed life into them with Allah's permission.'\" The Head of the Rabbis said: \"It is said that he did that but we did not see it.\" Al-Rida (AS) said: \"Have you seen the miracles performed by Moses? Have you not received the news by way of Moses's closest trustworthy companions who said he did them?\" The Head of the Rabbis said: \"Yes. That is so.\" The Imam (AS) said: \"Well. The news about the miracles of Jesus, the son of Mary, have reached you in a similar fashion. Why then did you acknowledge Moses and believe in him, but you did not believe in Jesus?\" The Head of the Rabbis did not answer. Al-Rida (AS) said: The same is true about Muhammad (SA) and his miracles. The same is true about any other prophet (AS) appointed by Allah. One of the miracles of Muhammad (SA) was that he was a poor hired shepherd. He had not been taught anything. He did not have any teachers. However, the Qur'an which he brought contains the stories of the prophets and the associated news letter by letter. It has narrated news of the past, and the things to come in the future all the way up until the Day of Resurrection. The Qur'an provided information about what people did in hiding or in their homes. The Prophet brought innumerable miracles. The Head of the Rabbis said: \"Neither the account about Jesus nor that about Muhammad (SA) is considered correct by us. It is not permissible to admit their Prophethood through what is not correct.\" Al-Rida (AS said: \"Has the witness who testified for Jesus (AS) and Muhammad (SA) then given false testimony?\" The Head of the Rabbis did not answer him.",

    "Content": "Then the Imam (AS) called the Zoroastrian High Priest. Al-Rida (AS) said to him, \"Let me know about Zoroaster who considered himself to be a prophet. What is your proof of his Prophethood?\" The Zoroastrian High Priest said: \"He performed miracles which no one ever had performed before him. Of course, I have not seen him, but the stories of our ancestors tell us that he made legitimate for us things which others had not made legitimate. Therefore, we follow him.\" The Imam (AS) asked, \"You believed in the stories which came to you about him, so you followed him, did you not?\" He replied, \"Yes.\" The Imam (AS) said: This is the case with all other nations. Stories came to them about what the prophets had accomplished, and what Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (AS) had all brought to them. So why did you not believe in any of these prophets, having believed in Zoroaster through the stories that came to you about him saying that he brought forth what others did not? The Zoroastrian High Priest froze in his place. Then al-Rida (AS) said: \"O people! If any of you is opposed to Islam, and wants to ask me any questions, then they should ask me and not be shy.\" Imran the Sabian, who was an expert in theology, stood up and said: O Scholar of the people! I would not have asked you any questions if you had not invited me to ask. I have been to Kufa, Basra, Syria, and Algeria. There I have met many theologians. However, none of them have been able to establish for me the proof that there is One who has no second other than Him, and that he is One Sole Being. Will you permit me to ask you this question? Al-Rida (AS) said: \"If Imran the Sabian is present among the people here, it must be you.\" He said: \"Yes. It is I.\" The Imam (AS) said: \"O Imran! Ask, but I advise you to be fair. Avoid vain talk and nonsense.\" Imran said: \"My Master! By Allah, I just want you to prove something which I can adhere to for me. Then I need not seek anything else.\" The Imam (AS) said: \"Ask whatever you wish to ask.\" The crowds moved closer to Imran and crowded in on him. Imran the Sabian asked, \"let me know of the first thing and what it created.\" Al-Rida (AS) replied to him. You asked. Now try to understand. As for the One. He has always been One Being. He has no limits nor does He have transient qualities. He will always remain so. Then, without precedence, He created a different creature with transient qualities and various different limits. He neither places it in anything, not did He limit it by anything. He neither created it like anything, nor did He create other things like it. He then created the creatures in various shapes: pure and impure, different and alike, with various colors, flavors and tastes. He did not create them out of a need for them, nor did He create them to attain a higher rank. He did not sense any increase or decrease in Himselg due to this creation. O Imran! Do you understand this? Imran said: \"By Allah, yes my Master!\" The Imam (AS) added, O Imran! Know that if He had created what He created due to His need for them, then He would have only created things by which He could fulfill His need. In that case, it would have been better for Him to create several times more than what He created, since the more the helpers there were, the more powerful their master would be. O Imran! In that case, His need would be a never-ending one. The more He would crate, the more newer needs would appear for Him. That is why we say that He did not create the creatures out of need. Through creation He transfers the needs of some of them to others. And He makes some of them nobler than others without any need of the nobler one or without wanting to take any revenge against those whom He had abased. That is how He has created. Imran asked, \"My Master! Was the Being known to Himself by His Own Self?\" Al-Rida (AS) said: Knowledge of something is required to distinguish it from other things, and to prove its existence through what is negated about it. However, there was nothing else there to oppose Him to make it necessary to negate. Since there was only Him, there was no need to establish limits. O Imran Do you understand? Imran said: \"Yes, by Allah, my Master! Then tell me: Through what means did He come to know what He knew. Was it done by conscience or by something else?\"",
